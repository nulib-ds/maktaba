# About

_Maktaba_ is a collaborative effort between the Northwestern University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to make their unique West African manuscript holdings accessible to non-specialist audiences through a digital collection. The _Maktaba_ collection features images of twenty West African Arabic and Ajami manuscripts from the libraries of these two universities. Each manuscript is accompanied by a transcription into typescript Arabic, an English translation, and an introductory essay providing cultural and historical context.

About half of the manuscripts featured in _Maktaba_ are from the collection of [Arabic manuscripts from West Africa](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/arabic-manuscripts) housed at the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies at Northwestern University. This collection of over 5,000 handwritten items is particularly strong in works by nineteenth and twentieth century scholars from the northern Nigeria and Ghana regions.

The other half are from the “Boutilimit Collection” of microfilmed manuscripts from southern Mauritania stored in the University of Illinois Archives as part of the “[Charles C. Stewart Papers](https://archon.library.illinois.edu/archives/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=1592&q=mauritania).” This collection of over 2,000 microfilmed manuscripts is from the family library of Haroun ould Sidiyya Baba (1917-1978) and dates from the nineteenth to early twentieth centuries.

Work on the Maktaba site was made possible by a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Division of Preservation and Access.
