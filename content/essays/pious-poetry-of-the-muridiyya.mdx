*Weeping Has Become Warranted* is an Arabic poem composed sometime between 1860 and 1894 by Ahmadu Bamba Mbacké (d. 1927), commonly known as Shaykh Ahmadu Bamba. A Sufi master, Ahmadu Bamba established a community of followers in Senegal in the 1880s that eventually emerged as a new Sufi order: the Tariqa Murīdiyya, which today claims millions of followers around globe. Ahmadu Bamba is sometimes described as Senegal's "national hero" and his image, based on the one known photograph of him (see Figure 1 at the end of the essay), adorns walls, homes, murals, offices, and vehicles throughout Senegal.

One of Ahmadu Bamba's legacies is his substantial corpus of Arabic poetry.[^2] Writing in Arabic verse was, and continues to be, common for West African Muslim authors, following a tradition dating to at least the twelfth century.[^3] Ahmadu Bamba was especially prolific, writing almost exclusively in verse---Murīd lore refers to his "seven \[metric\] tons of poetry" and "verses that could fill buildings."[^4] Ahmadu Bamba considered writing an act of devotion and service to the Prophet Muhammad. An examination of *Weeping Has Become Warranted* opens a window to the rich tradition of West African Sufi praise poetry and the important role of Ahmadu Bamba's poems--especially the oral recitation of them--in sustaining a spiritual community across time and space.

Ahmadu Bamba was born into a clerical family in the village of Mbakke in Bawol, one of the Wolof kingdoms of western Senegal.[^5] He began serious study of the Islamic sciences at an early age and continued to deepen his knowledge of these subjects throughout his life. In the 1860s, Bamba's family moved to the neighboring kingdom of Kajoor so that his father, an esteemed Islamic scholar, could serve as advisor and judge to Kajoor's king, Lat Joor (d. 1886). While assisting at his father's Islamic school, Ahmadu Bamba began to emerge as a respected teacher in his own right. He was particularly drawn to the subject of Sufism--the branch of the Islamic sciences that seeks divine truth through direct personal experience of God, focusing on the internal aspects of the faith.

Proximity to Lat Joor's court led Ahmadu Bamba to become increasingly critical of what he perceived as the corruption of the Kajoor ruling class and the Muslim clerics who advised them. He shocked the establishment by refusing to step into his father's shoes as Lat Joor's advisor after his father's death in 1883, instead embarking on a regional study tour to deepen his own religious understanding. Upon his return to Kajoor, Ahmadu Bamba informed his followers of a new orientation---henceforth he would focus exclusively on education of the soul, or *tarbiyya*.[^6] His innovative pedagogical approach, which eventually became the foundation of the Murīd movement,[^7] emphasized ethics and practical education over ritual and mastery of text-based Islamic scholarship.[^8] Importantly, he welcomed all to partake of the Islamic education he was offering, not only those born into clerical or scholarly families. The new pedagogy increased tensions between Ahmadu Bamba and the Kajoor establishment, precipitating Ahmadu Bamba's return to his homeland of Bawol in 1884. Over the next decade, he built his community and refined his educational methods. As his disciples grew more numerous, they founded several villages, including Touba, which eventually became the capital city of the Murīdiyya.

Ahmadu Bamba's movement grew during the turmoil of imperial intrusion into West Africa, as the French colonial government dismantled local rulers and tightened its control. Concerned that Ahmadu Bamba and his followers threatened French authority, the colonial administration arrested and tried Ahmadu Bamba in 1895 on charges of plotting to wage armed jihad against the French. Declaring him guilty, they exiled him to Gabon, in Central Africa. In fact, Ahmadu Bamba never embraced military jihad, advocating instead for the *jihad al-akbar* (greater jihad) of *nafs* (self). As he wrote in a poem, "The warrior in the path of God is not who takes his enemies' life, but the one who combats his nafs to achieve spiritual perfection."[^9]

Ahmadu Bamba viewed exile as a test of faith and spent his seven years of imprisonment in deep spiritual reflection. He perfected his knowledge of the Arabic language and wrote an important corpus of Arabic poetry. Contrary to French expectations that exile would quell the movement, it enhanced Ahmadu Bamba's reputation; when he was permitted to return to Senegal 1902, his disciples framed the return as a victory over colonial oppression. The French exiled Ahmadu Bamba again, this time to Mauritania. In 1907 they moved him to Senegal, first to Ceyeen-Jolof then Diourbel, where he remained, under "house arrest," until his death in 1927. Since then, the Murīdiyya has continued to grow in numbers and global reach. Today, an estimated four million Murīds live in Senegal and throughout the world, with significant diaspora communities in Europe, the United States, and Asia.[^10]

The poem *Weeping Has Become Warranted* dates from the pre-exile period of Ahmadu Bamba's career. He composed it sometime between 1860 and 1894, in response to a question posed by his teacher, Khāli Madiakhate Kala (d.1903).[^11] Like Ahmadu Bamba's father, Khāli Madiakhate was a judge (or qadi, the Wolofized version of which is "Khāli") at Lat Joor's court; he was also an accomplished poet who had tutored Ahmadu Bamba and others in the art of writing Arabic poetry.[^12] According to accounts collected by Ngom, Kala asked his student: "Since the Qurʾān teaches that heaven and earth did not mourn the death of the unrighteous such as Pharoah and his followers, should the deceased saints be mourned?"[^13] Ahmadu Bamba replied affirmatively with *Weeping Has Become Warranted*---a poem in one-hundred verses that eloquently evokes the qualities of the great Sufi masters. This poem would define Ahmadu Bamba's Sufi path for years to come[^14] by providing a "succinct definition of the Murid."[^15] Ngom observes that it is the first time the three Sufi concepts of service (*khidma*), love (*hubb*), and gifts (*hadiyya*) appear in Ahmadu Bamba's writing, in the following line: "Good fortune awaits a truthful, adherent servant who offers them service, love or gifts."[^16] As Babou notes, "Love (*hubb*), being at the service of the sheikh (*khidma*), and gift giving (*hadiyya*) are three central principles of Murid doctrine which define and bestow a tangible substance to the relations between sheikhs and disciples."[^17]

Murīds have a special relationship with Shaykh Bamba's poems, which they believe make certain blessings and mystical secrets from the Qurʾan accessible to them.[^18] Especially important is the *chanting* of Ahmadu Bamba's poetry, for Sufi praise poetry is a genre meant to be recited out loud.[^19] In the Murīd capital of Touba, public chanting of his poetry is ubiquitous, especially during the Grand Magal, an annual pilgrimage event commemorating the 1895 exile to Gabon. Ethnomusicologist Christine Dang observes that during the Magal, "Touba pulsates with the voices of believers reciting *qaṣāʾid*, or poems. As crowds of millions descend upon the road leading to Touba, the sounds of *qaṣāʾid* emanate from almost all stereo speakers or vehicles on their way. Voices raised in singing *qaṣāʾid* constitute the sacred soundtrack of the pilgrim's journey and the blessed soundscape of the pilgrim's destination. Around the mosque, massive speakers continuously radiate recordings of Bamba's poems at extremely high volumes."[^20]

To hear how *Weeping Has Become Warranted* sounds when recited by a group, watch the following video, filmed in Touba in 2022:

In the video, the reciters turn pages that look much like the pages of the text displayed in *Maktaba*. The relatively large size of the script and the fact that the text is fully vocalized--meaning that short vowels are added to facilitate proper pronunciation--indicate that the version of the text digitized for *Maktaba* was meant to be used for recitation.

Editions of Ahmadu Bamba's poems (and the poetry of other West African Muslim authors) are sold by vendors outside mosques and in bookstalls throughout Muslim West Africa. These so-called "market editions" are hand-written texts that have been duplicated (initially lithographed and later photocopied) and turned into booklets. Market editions emerged in mid-twentieth century West Africa as "a halfway house between the manuscript tradition and printing proper." [^21] Ahmadu Bamba\'s followers made a great effort after their Shaykh's death to collect and publish his poetry. Murīd disciples such as Issa Niang (whose printing house produced the copy displayed in *Maktaba*--see the back cover) initially sent metal plates of the handwritten text to be printed in North Africa and the Middle East; by the 1950s, Shaykh Bamba's poems were more commonly printed in Senegal by local printers such as Niang.[^22]

According to Murīd scholar Al-Ḥājj Mbakke, Ahmadu Bamba once said that "if his poems were birds, the readers would be their wings, and the listeners would be their feathers."[^23] Just as Bamba considered writing poetry a devotional act to the Prophet Muhammad, Murīd disciples who collect, print, and distribute Bamba's poems so that they can be read, recited, and heard, are serving their beloved Shaykh, ensuring that his legacy--and their community--endure and thrive.

While Ahmadu Bamba wrote mostly in Arabic, he encouraged his disciples to use *ʿAjamī*

    (non-Arabic languages---in this case Wolof---written in an enriched form of the Arabic script) so that his religious teachings would be accessible to the masses.

[^6]: Babou defines *tarbiyya* as "a holistic approach to education invented by the Sufis that goes beyond the mere transmission of knowledge and seeks to transform the whole being by touching the body, mind, and soul." *Fighting the Greater Jihad*, 63.

[^7]: As Ngom notes, Ahmadu Bamba never gave his movement a name "because he intended it to be a universal call for those seeking a path for spiritual and moral development and union with God." Ahmadu Bamba referred to his followers as "Murīds," which simply means "seeker," or in a Sufi context, "spiritual wayfarers." Eventually, his movement came to be called the "Murīdiyya."

[^11]: According to Murīd accounts collected by Ngom, Ahmadu Bamba composed the poem between 1860 and 1870, while he was still a student of Kala. See Ngom, *Muslims Beyond*, 108, note 130. Babou places the composition date later, around 1894. See *Fighting the Greater Jihad*, 229, note 34.

[^12]: Kala authored a work titled *Mubayyin al-ishkāl* (The Book of Meter), a technical guide to Arabic meter and verse. As a teaching method, he sometimes co-authored poems with his students, using both Arabic and Wolof ʿ*Ajamī*. See Ngom, "Ahmadu Bamba," 3.
