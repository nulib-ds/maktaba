# Essays

### Texts in Context
The handwritten Arabic manuscripts featured in *Maktaba* are valuable, but often overlooked, testaments--in poetry and prose--to the thoughts, beliefs, concerns, and creativity of West African Muslims. Making this rich primary source material from the collections at Northwestern University and the University of Illinois accessible to English-speaking audiences requires not only translation, but contextualization.

Each translated manuscript has been introduced in a brief essay explaining who the author was (if known), why the text may have been written, and what it was used for. In most cases the translator of the text also wrote the contextual essay, but occasionally members of the *Maktaba* project team have authored or co-authored essays.

### Notable Authors
Most of the authors featured in *Maktaba* lived in the late eighteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries, with one notable exception: Muḥammad al-Kābarī, a fifteenth-century scholar from Timbuktu (Mali) whose *Garden of Benefits and Advantages* may be the oldest extant Arabic text written by a West African scholar. Al-Kābarī's [introduction to this text](/essays/foundational-islamic-theology) is translated and contextualized here.

The *Maktaba* collection contains works by some of the most influential Muslim leaders in West Africa, including Shehu Usuman dan Fodio (d. 1811), the founder of the Sokoto Caliphate that still stands as the Muslim-majority identity of northern Nigeria; as well as [Amadu Bamba](/essays/pious-poetry-of-the-muridiyya) (d. 1927) and [Ibrahim Niasse](/essays/model-of-a-mystical-path) (d. 1975), founders of the two most important Sufi orders of West Africa: the Mūridiyya and the Tijāniyya Niassene, respectively. It also contains a cluster of texts appertaining to the [Sīdiyyā family], influential in the Saharan West (today's Mauritania) for multiple generations as scholars, jurists, spiritual leaders of the Qādiriyya Sufi order, and brokers of economic and political power.

### Navigating Daily Life
In addition to these texts by well-known scholars, *Maktaba* features works never before translated into English that open windows onto more quotidian practices and concerns, such as [how to divide an inheritance](/essays/legal-note-from-southwestern-mauritania) according to Islamic law, or how to clean your teeth with the *siwāk*, or chewing stick, both to prevent disease and to follow the example of the Prophet Muḥammad. Translated here for the first time is also [a collection of fourteen *fāʾidas*](/essays/bestowing-benefits-and-preventing-harm)--a genre of texts offering specific recipes, practices, or actions that offer the user assistance in times of need. These short texts from northern Nigeria provide a non-elite perspective on the struggles and strategies of everyday life for West African Muslim communities of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

### Responses to Imperialism
Another highlight of the *Maktaba* collection is the cluster of manuscripts that provide insight into the shifting power dynamics and growing challenges brought about by European intrusion into West Africa--a dynamic that begin with commercial relations in the seventeenth century, intensified in the nineteenth century with the [gum Arabic trade](/essays/the-french-and-gum-arabic-trade-in-the-senegal-valley) on the Senegal river, and culminated in European conquest of large swaths of West Africa in the late nineteenth century and the establishment of formal colonial rule in the early twentieth century.
