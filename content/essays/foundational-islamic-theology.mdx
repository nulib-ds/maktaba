# Foundational Islamic Theology in a Fifteenth-Century West African Arabic Manuscript

## An Introduction to *The Garden of Benefits and Advantages (Bustān al-Fawāʾid wa l-Manafiʿ)* by Muḥammad al-Kābarī [^1]

Muḥammad al-Kābarī's *Garden of Benefits and Advantages* (*Bustān al-Fawāʾid wa l-Manāfiʿ*), dating from the fifteenth century, may be the oldest extant Arabic text written by a West African scholar. The *Maktaba* project displays a seventy-page copy of al-Kābarī's text that was probably made in Nigeria in the nineteenth century. The portion of the text translated for *Maktaba* is the two-page introduction concerning the basics of Islamic theology (*ʿaqīda*). Because roughly eighty-five percent of the contents of al-Kābarī's text--at least in the manuscript versions available for consultation--concern various prayers, secrets, or remedies for protection or healing, relatively little attention has been afforded the author's introduction.[^2] Even if it mostly reproduces the earlier "Rightly Guided Theology" (*al-ʿAqīda al-Murshida*) of the foundational Almohad reformer Ibn Tumart (d. 1130, Morocco), this eloquent introduction provided the lens by which al-Kābarī meant the rest of his work to be read. Most of the *Bustān*'s initial pages thus faithfully transcribe Ibn Tumart's words, but al-Kābarī does add some of his own theological reflections.

There is no doubt that Muḥammad al-Kābarī (fl. 1450) was one of the most important scholars in Timbuktu in the fifteenth century. Likely of Soninke background from the region of Kābara, on the southwestern side of the inner Niger Delta,[^3] al-Kābarī's influence as the formative teacher of both Timbuktu's later "saintly pole" (*quṭb*), the *sharīf* Yaḥyā al-Tadallisī (d. 1462), and the first of many Sanhaja chief judges in the city, *qāḍī* ʿUmar Aqīt (d. 1468-1480),[^4] usefully destabilizes later colonial-era stereotypes describing the instruction of Islam from "white" Arab masters to "black" African followers. Although the Arabic chronicles of the Songhay empire identify al-Kābarī primarily as a jurist (*faqīh*), it was no doubt the *Bustān al-Fawāʾid* that ensured his lasting fame throughout West Africa. Although complete versions of the manuscript are relatively hard to find, the book appears to have had a wide renown. An anecdote from Senegal--where the prominent Tijānī scholar and successor (*khalīfa*) of Ibrāhīm Niasse, ʿAlī Cisse (d. 1982), reproduced sections of the *Bustān* in his own private manuscript (*kunnāsh*) on the healing sciences--suggests that Kābarī's text circulated among a West African scholarly elite well into the twentieth century.[^5]

After the formulaic praise to God and invocation of blessing on the Prophet Muḥammad, al-Kābarī begins the *Bustān* by declaring his intention to gather the "benefits and advantages" from the wise folk of past generations. The Arabic words *fawāʾid* and *manāfiʿ* are of somewhat ambiguous meaning. Besides "benefits," *fawāʾid* can also mean extra things: a *fāʾida* (sing.) can mean a supplemental note in a larger text; or a special (but non-obligatory) prayer mentioned in a larger prayer manual. Besides "advantages," *manāfiʿ* can also mean things that are generally useful or profitable.[^6] An alternative, but less literal, translation of the work might thus be, "The Garden of Special and Profitable Prayers." But it is clear that al-Kābarī considered basic Islamic theology and foundational scripture--not only, for example, ways to attract women to men, as included among the later parts of the text--to be encompassed among the "benefits and advantages" God gave to humanity, and worthy of transcription in the *Bustān*.

Al-Kābarī's introduction is mostly preoccupied with the invocation of the Muslim doctrine of God's oneness (*tawḥīd*). In reproducing Ibn Tūmart's short catechism on the subject in its entirety, the *Bustān* suggests that such works might be considered as advantageous special prayers--some to heal the body and some to heal the soul. Ibn Tūmart's *al-ʿAqīda al-Murshida* appears to have been the primary pedagogical text for the teaching of basic theology through North and West Africa from the twelfth to the fifteenth/sixteenth centuries, when it would be gradually replaced by Muḥammad al-Sanūsī's *al-ʿAqīda al-Ṣughrā.*[^7] The *al-ʿAqīda al-Murshida,* like other treatises of the Ashʿarī theological school, was marked by a condensed simplicity aiming to strike a middle path between the perceived heretical extremes of anthropomorphism and philosophical abstraction in the understanding of divine attributes.[^8] If God describes Himself with a hand in the Qurʾan--for example "*Glory to Him in whose hand is the dominion of all things,"*[^9]--a Muslim should not err, neither in believing God's hand was like a created, human hand, nor in denying that God has a hand. As the famous Ḥanbalī scholar and Qādirī Sufi Ibn Qudāma (d. 1223, Damascus) asserted:

> We say exactly what He has said, and describe Him as He has described Himself, without going beyond His description, nor removing from Him any of His attributes ... He is, according to His own description, the Hearing, the Seeing, boundless and immeasurable. His attributes proceed from Him and are His own.[^10]

Muslim scholars, especially "traditionalists" (*ḥadīth* scholars) and Sufis like Ibn Qudāma, thus often considered theological dialectics an anathema to genuine religious sincerity.

But where al-Ghazālī and Ibn Qudāma in the East were primarily reacting to the Muʿtazilite rationalization of divine attributes, Ibn Tūmart in the West was reacting to what he understood as the illogical anthropomorphism of the Almoravids. In one text, Ibn Tūmart castigated the Almoravids as *mujassimūn* referenced in an alleged *ḥadīth*: "Oppose the Jews, oppose the polytheists, the Zorastrians, and also the corporealists (*al-mujassimūn*) who are among the infidels. They wear women's attire in that they cover their faces with a veil."[^11] As Norris observes, "to Muḥammad ibn Tūmart the Almoravids were corporealists and anthropomorphists, to whom the vision of the divine was material and literal to the point of idolatry."[^12] In other words, unbalanced Almoravid enthusiasm for the law through dogmatic practice of the Mālikī school, had precluded necessary theological reflection as it had their recognition of God's special friends or saints (*awliyāʾ*) independent of jurists (*fuqahāʾ*). Clearly then, Ibn Tūmart viewed his own short summary of purified *tawḥīd* as a protection against this altogether blameworthy anthropomorphism.[^13] The later intellectual heritage of North and West Africa seems to have downplayed the irreconciliability between the Almoravids and the Almohads---after all Ibn Tūmart was a Mālikī himself---integrating practice of the Mālikī school, the Ashʿarī position between anthromorphism and allegorical rationalization, and Ghazalian Sufism. By the fifteenth century, al-Kābarī's redeployment of Ibn Tūmart's *al-ʿAqīda al-Murshida* would have thus been largely unencumbered of the virulent theological controversies in the early twelfth century.

Rather than criticizing perceived anthropomorphists, al-Kābarī no doubt uses Ibn Tūmart's catechism to address a significant liability in the employment of the type of powerful spiritual weaponry the *Bustān* contains. Indeed, a recent analysis of similar manuscripts in West Africa describes their contents as "magic discourses,"[^14] perhaps suggesting that works like the *Bustān* might be considered magic spell-books. Even if al-Kābarī would not have described his own practices as magic/sorcery (*siḥr*), the capacity to access the hidden power of the Qurʾan, divine names, and Arabic letters certainly presented a challenge to the ordinary Muslim. If a specific talisman constructed with particular verses of the Qurʾan was found to be efficacious in protecting the wearer from the "evil eye" or for attracting love among creation, a person might come to rely on the amulet rather than on God for the obtainment of his need. As the Ottoman scholar Mehmed Birgivi (d. 1573) reasoned: "It is possible that charms and spells are forbidden only to those who think that they are the only means of cure. Those who believe both sickness and its cure are from God, and that medical intervention is in the hand of God, may also use charms and spells."[^15] Or, in the words of the Egyptian Sufi ʿAbd al-Wahhāb al-Shaʿrānī (d. 1565), "Know that the subsidiary causes (*asbāb*) are all in the hand of God, and He is the healer, none other ... everything other than Him is but a means (*sabab*)."[^16]

Attention to the mostly overlooked introduction to the *Bustān* elucidates al-Kābarī's position on the proper use of the "benefits and advantages" described in the text; moreover, it helps to situate the thought of this important fifteenth-century scholar of Timbuktu within broader debates among Muslim scholars about esoteric knowledge and practices. For al-Kābarī, beginning his text with Ibn Tūmart's coherent articulation of God's Oneness served to remind his reader that there is no power or cause in creation except God's power and agency. Wearing a talisman for protection in battle, for example, was no different for the Godservant than donning metal armor. God was the ultimate protector, and seeking God's protection by means of secondary causes in the creation was simply good manners with the Creator.

Cisse's title, *Muʿawanat al-ikhwān fī maʿāshirat al-niswān* ("The Assistance of Brothers over Each and Every Woman") reveals the primary focus on prayers to increase male virility, also a primary preoccupation of al-Kābarī's text. The title is also identical to an earlier Sokoto text of Muḥammad al-Takūr, see Ismail Abdalla, "Islamic Medicine and its Influence on Traditional Hausa Practitioners in Northern Nigeria" (PhD diss., University of Wisconsin, 1981), 163; Wright, "Islamic Intellectual Tradition," 69; however, the specifically Tijānī prayers of much of the later pages (incidentally having little to do with male-female relations) might indicate that Cisse accessed al-Kābarī's text through that of al-Takūr, and then added a number of other prayers.
