# Bestowing Benefits and Preventing Harm

## An Introduction to a Selection of *Fāʾida*s (Anonymous, c. late 19th - mid 20th century)

*Fāʾida*s are a genre of texts offering specific recipes, ritual practices or physical actions that promise the user supernatural assistance in times of need.[^1] They are so-called because the Arabic word *fāʾida*, meaning "beneficial" or "useful," is often the first word encountered.[^2] These texts are, as a result, relatively easy to identify. *Fāʾida*s often appear on the otherwise blank folio immediately before or after unrelated longer compositions or, as in the examples translated for *Maktaba*, on single scraps of paper. A single *fāʾida* is invariably short, usually no more than a single page in length. However, collections of *fāʾida*s--either various recipes written down together or, more commonly, a single recipe with multiple variations--can be significantly longer.

Although a full chronology for the development of *fāʾida*s in West Africa is yet to be written, they can be traced back to the genre referred to variously as *Faḍāʾil al-Qurʾan* or *Khawāṣṣ al-Qurʾan*, a genre of Arabic writing that emerged in the first few centuries of Islam that attributed specific benefits to reciting certain verses from the Qurʾan and, later, miraculous qualities to the written text itself.[^3] Documents resembling *fāʾida*s can be found in manuscript collections from across the Muslim world.[^4] However, it is in collections of West African provenance that these items are so numerous and so standardized.[^5] In the Hausa context, where the *fāʾida*s translated here come from, it was *malamai*--local practitioners of Islamic knowledge--who generally wrote such documents, charging for their services. And while the patient would take the *fāʾida* with them, the documents we are seeing here are the templates for such cures which the *malam* presumably kept with him or her.[^6] Scholars and bibliophiles also collected these remedies, usually writing them down on the front or back of books they owned or on scraps of paper. Therefore, although *fāʾida*s preserved today are invariably anonymous, each was written to address a specific medical, psychological, or spiritual concern of the user. Like the *fatwa* (a legal ruling), *fāʾida*s therefore constitute a source of social history rarely found in other manuscript sources such as chronicles, political treatises, or works of literature.

The content of a *fāʾida* is extremely formulaic. After the word *fāʾida*, if it appears, is the statement of purpose, that is, the need that the *fāʾida* is addressing.[^7] The language used to describe the purpose is relatively standardized. Broadly speaking, this ranges from curing sicknesses of the body or mind, improving physical and mental abilities and bestowing happiness and good luck, to affording the user protection in and out of the home, controlling natural elements, or curtailing the actions of other people. The translated examples give a representative sample of these different purposes.

After expressing the purpose of the *fāʾida*, next we come to the method. This is often indicated by the Arabic word *man,* meaning "whoever...", and an appropriate verb. By far the most common instruction is to "write." This indicates that the *fāʾida* is achieved through producing written text, whether writing out an amulet (*khātim*) or number square (*jadwal*), or else writing on a writing board (*lawḥ*) and washing off the text to create a liquid (known in Hausa as *rubutu*) that can be imbibed or applied to the body. Indeed, following the words "whoever writes" (*man kataba*) one will often find the words *wa-sharaba* *wa-ghasala* (and drinks and washes). Such condensed, shorthand language suggests that users already knew the basic preparation methods for their cures. Often the user is instructed to "attach" (*ʿallaqa)* the amulet, usually about the body, or to bury it (*dafana*) in a particular place. Other common instructions include reading particular words a given number of times, or repeating elements of the Muslim prayer ritual.

Once the purpose of the *fāʾida* and the method for achieving that purpose have been established, the third and final part of the *fāʾida* is the vessel, that is, whatever is to be written, washed, drunk, buried, read, or prayed. The vessel is often indicated by the Arabic *wa-huwa* or *wa-hiya* (and it is...). Verses from the Qurʾan are the primary means of "activating" the *fāʾida*, selected because they contain a word, phrase or context that is relevant to their use.[^8] However, supplications (*adʿiyah),* a prayer formula, or verses from popular texts such as al-Būṣīrī's poem on the Prophet's mantle (*al-Burda*)[^9] or al-Jazūlī's book of prayers, *Dalāʾil al-khayrāt*, are also used. Amulets can consist of a number or letter square (*jadwal*), which sometimes works like a Sudoku in that the numbers of each line add up to the same total. In other cases, especially for love *fāʾida*s, the cells of the square are filled with the letters making up the user's name, or from a powerful word or phrase. The squares are sometimes surrounded by the names of prophets, angels, *jinn*, or historical figures.[^10] Aside from the *jadwal*, the *fāʾida* is often activated by series of Arabic letters that do not form recognisable words. There can be many explanations for such letters. In many cases the letters are ciphers pertaining to the discipline of numerology (*ʿilm al-ḥurūf*) which assigns a numerical value (and characteristics) to each letter of the Arabic alphabet. This allows for phrases or names--such as a name of God--to be expressed as a number or, conversely, for a seemingly unrecognisable series of letters to be "converted" to recognisable phrases and names because they add up to the same number.[^11] Other examples include symbols that correspond to the Arabic alphabet, or charaktêres or "string letters" that do not correspond with any known alphabet.[^12] Rarely, images of animals, human figures or other symbolic drawings serve as the amulet.

Whereas the vessel is usually in the Arabic language, or at least using numerical or other ciphers that translate to Arabic words, *fāʾida*s often work in tandem with local trees, plants and animal products written in *ʿajamī* (vernacular African languages expressed in Arabic script). In the translated examples, which were made in northern Nigeria, the language is Hausa. But examples in Fulfulde and Bambara are also common.[^13] Across much of West Africa, large-scale conversion to Islam occurred only in the nineteenth century. It is therefore likely that these documents demonstrate the fusion of pre-existing pharmacological traditions with the Qurʾanic medicine taught and practiced by Muslim scholars.

Aside from the *ʿajamī* language that is used, *fāʾida*s from different regions of West Africa are almost identical in their composition, the range of needs they address, and their methodology in fulfilling them. This suggests a common origin for such practices and a strong culture of transmission, suggestions which at the present we do not have the requisite knowledge to explore further. Although simple to identify and relatively easy to understand, *fāʾida*s have been rarely studied and even more rarely translated. This is largely because the vague language typically used to describe these items in manuscript catalogs--"magic," "esoteric," "secret"--does little more than lump *fāʾida*s together with a range of related genres such as sand divination (*ʿilm al-raml)*, dream interpretation, and divination, and screen them off from "regular" manuscript material. The result is to make *fāʾida*s, when they are cataloged at all, practically invisible, and a comparison of *fāʾidas* in different collections nigh impossible. The fifteen *fāʾida*s translated for *Maktaba* were selected from thirty boxes of uncatalogued miscellaneous fragments belonging to the ʿUmar Falke Collection, held at Northwestern's Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies.[^14] They were written between the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries.

[^1]: This essay introduces the *fāʾida* genre in the West African context. Fifteen *fāʾida*s were selected for inclusion in *Maktaba* from boxes of miscellaneous uncataloged fragments in the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies, ʿUmar Falke Collection, Northwestern University Libraries. Wendell Marsh and Aicha Azzaoui assisted me in selecting the *fāʾida*s.

[^2]:  The plural of *fāʾida* is *fawāʾid*, though here for ease of reference I use the anglicized plural, "*fāʾida*s." Note that in other Islamic manuscript traditions, and even within other genres of Islamic manuscripts from West Africa, the word *fāʾida* also serves the function of the *nota bene* frequently encountered in Latin manuscript tradition, indicating that the reader should take special notice of the text that follows. This is most common in the context of Islamic law, where particularly apposite examples of legal cases are denoted by this term in the margins of the page.

[^4]: One interesting source of such material outside West Africa is the archives of the Roman Inquisition in Malta. Documents very similar to *fāʾida*s were preserved as evidence in trials of witchcraft and sorcery. These documents were written by Muslims predominantly from North Africa but also from Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, as well as sub-Saharan Africa, who had been taken to Malta as slaves.

[^5]: Nehemia Levtzion (1965, p. 100n) stated that "over ninety per cent" of Arabic manuscripts from Kumasi, Ghana, held at the Royal Library of Copenhagen, "may be described as magical formulas, or prescriptions for preparing amulets." See Nehemia Levtzion, "Early Nineteenth-Century Manuscripts from Kumasi," *Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana* 8 (1965): 100. Charles Stewart notes that at least one quarter of the more than 350,000 manuscripts in the thirty-five Timbuktu libraries managed by SAVAMA-DCI are described as *fāʾidas* or equivalent terms. See Charles C. Stewart, "What's in the Manuscripts of Timbuktu? A Survey of the Contents of 31 Private Libraries," *History in Africa* 48 (2021): 295. And a pilot project to digitize the family libraries of Djenné, Mali estimated that "more than 50%" of the manuscripts "dealt with 'esoteric' subjects." See the British Library Endangered Archive Program, https://eap.bl.uk/project/EAP488.

[^6]: This is at least what the evidence suggests, as many *fāʾida*s have "so-and-so" (*fulān*) in place of the personal names to be used in a love charm, etc.

[^7]: Occasionally the word *ḥirz* ("charm") is used in place of *fāʾida*. However, this seems to be for particular types of *fāʾida* like those called *Ḥirz al-ḥadīd*, which protect the user from metal weapons such as swords and spears.

[^8]: To give one example, a *fāʾida* to cure eye problems includes a verse taken from the Qurʾanic story of Yūsuf (12:93): "Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see \[clearly\]," while *fāʾidas* for love or to conceive a child use verses containing the Arabic word *azwāj*, literally "pairs" but taken to mean husbands and wives--such as Qurʾan 36:36 and 66:1. See Ali Diakite and Paul Naylor, "Medical and Pharmacological Remedies with Qurʾanic Verses in Nineteenth-Century Manuscripts from Timbuktu" in *Soul and Body Diseases, Remedies and Healing in Middle Eastern Religious Cultures and Traditions*, ed.

[^9]: On this see Suzanne Stetkevych, \"From Text to Talisman: Al-Būsīrī\'s Qasīdat al-Burdah (Mantle Ode) and the Supplicatory Ode,\" *Journal of Arabic Literature* 37, no. 2 (2006): 145-89.

[^11]: In non-esoteric usage, this system also allows dates to be expressed as a series of letters. Such "*abjad*" date formats are common in the West African manuscript tradition. For more examples of *abjad* usage in *Maktaba*, see the translations of [*Entrance to the Water Gorge of History-Colonial Poem 1*](https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/works/entrance-to-the-water-gorge-of-history-by-one-who-comes-to-it-with-insight-colonial-poem-1-al-ajj-um), pg. 8, notes 2 and 3; and [*And Now, Our Purpose is to String Pearls-Colonial Poem 2*](https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/works/and-now-our-purpose-is-to-string-pearls-for-notifying-and-warning-nobility-colonial-poem-2-al-ajj-um), pg. 18, notes 23 and 25.

[^12]: Conversion tables for such symbols are common in manuscript collections from the region. For example, SAV ABS 07368 from the Aboubacar Ben Said Library in Timbuktu, Mali, accessible online through the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library's Reading Room, https://w3id.org/vhmml/readingRoom/view/158985.

[^13]: See Diakite and Naylor, "Medical Texts from Timbuktu."

[^14]: "The ʿUmar Falke Collection" refers to the collection of manuscripts assembled by ʿUmar b. Abī Bakr Ramadān b. Abī Bakr b. Muhammad al-Mujāhid al-Ṭawāriqī al-Kanawī al-Tijāni, known as ʿUmar Falke (d. 1962) which resides at the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies. While a portion of the manuscripts in the Falke collection were authored by Falke himself, it is important to bear in mind that he was a bibliophile and collector of manuscripts and the items in the boxes from which this selection of *fāʾida*s were drawn should not be assumed to have been written by or used by Falke.
