# Bestowing Benefits and Preventing Harm

## An Introduction to a Selection of Fawʾāid [^1]

*Paul Naylor*

Fāʾidahs are a genre of texts offering specific recipes, ritual practices or physical actions that promise the user supernatural assistance in times of need. They are so-called because the Arabic word *fāʾidah*, meaning "beneficial" or "useful," is often the first word encountered.[^2] These texts are, as a result, relatively easy to identify. Fāʾidahs often appear on the otherwise blank folio immediately before or after unrelated longer compositions or, as in these examples, on single scraps of paper. A single fāʾidah is invariably short, usually no more than a single page in length. However, collections of fāʾidahs -- either various recipes written down together or, more commonly, a single recipe with multiple variations -- can be significantly longer.

Although a full chronology for the development of fāʾidahs in West Africa is yet to be written, they can be traced back to the genre referred to variously as *Faḍāʾil al-Qurʾān* or *Khawāṣṣ al-Qurʾān*, a genre of Arabic writing that emerged in the first few centuries of Islam that attributed specific benefits to reciting certain verses from the Qurʾan and, later, miraculous qualities to the written text itself.[^3] Documents resembling fāʾidahs can be found in manuscript collections from across the Muslim world.[^4] However, it is in collections of West African provenance that these items are so numerous and so standardized.[^5] In the Hausa context, where the fāʾidahs translated here come from, it was *malamai* -- local practitioners of Islamic knowledge -- who generally wrote such documents, charging for their services. And while the patient would take the fāʾidah with them, the documents we are seeing here are the templates for such cures which the *malam* presumably kept with him or her.[^6] Scholars and bibliophiles also collected these remedies, usually writing them down on the front or back of books they owned or, in the case of Umar Falke, on scraps of paper. Therefore, although fāʾidahs preserved today are invariably anonymous, each was written to address a specific medical, psychological, or spiritual concern of the user. Like the fatwa, fāʾidahs therefore constitute a source of social history rarely found in other manuscript sources such as chronicles, political treatises, or works of literature.

The content of a fāʾidah is extremely formulaic. After the word fāʾidah, if it appears, is the statement of purpose, that is, the need that the fāʾidah is addressing.[^7] The language used to describe the purpose is relatively standardized. Broadly speaking, this ranges from curing sicknesses of the body or mind, improving physical and mental abilities and bestowing happiness and good luck, to affording the user protection in and out of the home, controlling natural elements, or curtailing the actions of other people. The following examples give a representative sample of these different purposes.

After expressing the purpose of the fāʾidah, next we come to the method. This is often indicated by the Arabic word *man,* meaning "whoever...", and an appropriate verb. By far the most common instruction is to "write." This indicates that the fāʾidah is achieved through producing written text, whether writing out an amulet (*khātim*) or number square (*jadwal*), or else writing on a writing board (*lawḥ*) and washing off the text to create a liquid (known in Hausa as *rubutu*) that can be imbibed or applied to the body. Indeed, following the words "whoever writes" (*man kataba*) one will often find the words *wa-sharaba* *wa-ghasala* (and drinks and washes). Such condensed, shorthand language suggests that users already knew the basic preparation methods for their cures. Often the user is instructed to "attach" (*ʿallaqa)* the amulet, usually about the body, or to bury it (*dafana*) in a particular place. Other common instructions include reading particular words a given number of times, or repeating elements of the Muslim prayer ritual.

Once the purpose of the fāʾidah and the method for achieving that purpose have been established, the third and final part of the fāʾidah is the vessel, that is, whatever is to be written, washed, drunk, buried, read, or prayed. The vessel is often indicated by the Arabic *wa-huwa* or *wa-hiya* (and it is...). Verses from the Qurʾan are the primary means of "activating" the fāʾidah, selected because they contain a word, phrase or context that is relevant to their use.[^8] However, supplications (*adʿiyah),* a prayer formula, or verses from popular texts such as al-Būṣīrī's poem on the Prophet's mantle (al-Burdah)[^9] or al-Jazūlī's book of prayers, *Dalāʾil al-khayrāt*, are also used. Amulets can consist of a number or letter square (*jadwal*), which sometimes works like a Sudoku in that the numbers of each line add up to the same total. In other cases, especially for love fāʾidahs, the cells of the square are filled with the letters making up the user's name, or from a powerful word or phrase. The squares are sometimes surrounded by the names of prophets, angels, jinn, or historical figures.[^10] Aside from the *jadwal*, the fāʾidah is often activated by series of Arabic letters that do not form recognisable words. There can be many explanations for such letters. In many cases the letters are ciphers pertaining to the discipline of numerology (*ʿilm al-ḥurūf*) which assigns a numerical value (and characteristics) to each letter of the Arabic alphabet. This allows for phrases or names -- such as a name of God -- to be expressed as a number or, conversely, for a seemingly unrecognisable series of letters to be "converted" to recognisable phrases and names because they add up to the same number.[^11] Other examples include symbols that correspond to the Arabic alphabet, or charaktêres or "string letters" that do not correspond with any known alphabet.[^12] Rarely, images of animals, human figures or other symbolic drawings serve as the amulet.

Whereas the vessel is usually in the Arabic language, or at least using numerical or other ciphers that translate to Arabic words, fāʾidahs often work in tandem with local trees, plants and animal products written in *ʿajamī* (vernacular African languages expressed in Arabic script). In these examples, which were made in northern Nigeria, the language is Hausa. But examples in Fulfulde and Bambara are also common.[^13] Across much of West Africa, large-scale conversion to Islam occurred only in the nineteenth century. It is therefore likely that these documents demonstrate the fusion of pre-existing pharmacological traditions with the Qurʾanic medicine taught and practiced by Muslim scholars.

Aside from the *ʿajamī* language that is used, fāʾidahs from different regions of West Africa are almost identical in their composition, the range of needs they address, and their methodology in fulfilling them. This suggests a common origin for such practices and a strong culture of transmission, suggestions which at the present we do not have the requisite knowledge to explore further. Although simple to identify and relatively easy to understand, fāʾidahs have been rarely studied and even more rarely translated. This is largely because the vague language typically used to describe these items in manuscript catalogs -- "magic," "esoteric," "secret" -- does little more than lump fāʾidahs together with a range of related genres such as sand divination (*ʿilm al-raml)*, dream interpretation, and divination, and screen them off from "regular" manuscript material. The result is to make fāʾidahs, when they are cataloged at all, practically invisible, and a comparison of fāʾidahs in different collections nigh impossible. The following fāʾidahs were selected from thirty boxes of uncatalogued miscellaneous fragments belonging to the Umar Falke Collection, held at Northwestern's Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies.[^14] They were written between the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries.

[^1]: *A Selection of Fawʾāid* (title of the work assigned by the *Maktaba* project), Arabic Manuscripts from West Africa, Umar Falke Collection, uncatalogued fragments from boxes 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, Northwestern University Libraries.

[^2]:  The plural of *fāʾidah* is *fawāʾid*, though here for ease of reference I use "fāʾidahs." Note that in other Islamic manuscript traditions, and even within other genres of Islamic manuscripts from West Africa, the word *fāʾidah* also serves the function of the *nota bene* frequently encountered in Latin manuscript tradition, indicating that the reader should take special notice of the text that follows. This is most common in the context of Islamic law, where particularly apposite examples of legal cases are denoted by this term in the margins of the page.

[^4]: One interesting source of such material outside West Africa is the archives of the Roman Inquisition in Malta. Documents very similar to fāʾidahs were preserved as evidence in trials of witchcraft and sorcery. These documents were written by Muslims predominantly from North Africa but also from Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, as well as sub-Saharan Africa, who had been taken to Malta as slaves.

[^5]: Nehemia Levtzion (1965, p. 100n) stated that "over ninety per cent" of Arabic manuscripts from Kumasi, Ghana, held at the Royal Library of Copenhagen, "may be described as magical formulas, or prescriptions for preparing amulets." Charles Stewart (2021, p. 296) notes that at least one quarter of the more than 350,000 manuscripts in the 35 Timbuktu libraries managed by SAVAMA-DCI are described as fāʾidahs or equivalent terms. And a pilot project to digitize the family libraries of Djenné estimated that "more than 50%" of the manuscripts "dealt with 'esoteric' subjects" (See https://eap.bl.uk/project/EAP488).

[^6]: This is at least what the evidence suggests, as many fāʾidahs have "so-and-so" (*fulān*) in place of the personal names to be used in a love charm, etc.

[^7]: Occasionally the word *ḥirz* ("charm") is used in place of *fāʾidah*. However, this seems to be for particular types of fāʾidah like those called *Ḥirz al-ḥadīd*, which protect the user from metal weapons such as swords and spears.

[^8]: To give one example, a fāʾidah to cure eye problems includes a verse taken from the Qurʾanic story of Yusuf (12:93): "Go with this my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father: he will come to see \[clearly\]," while fāʾidahs for love or to conceive a child use verses containing the Arabic word *azwāj*, literally "pairs" but taken to mean husbands and wives -- such as Qurʾan 36:36 and 66:1.

[^11]: In non-esoteric usage, this system also allows dates to be expressed as a series of letters. Such "abjad" date formats are common in the West African manuscript tradition.

[^12]: Conversion tables for such symbols are common in manuscript collections from the region. For example, SAV ABS 07368 from the Aboubacar Ben Said Library in Timbuktu, Mali, accessible via: https://w3id.org/vhmml/readingRoom/view/158985.

[^14]: "The Umar Falke Collection" refers to the collection of manuscripts assembled by ʿUmar b. Abī Bakr Ramadān b. Abī Bakr b. Muhammad al-Mujāhid al-Ṭawāriqī al-Kanawī al-Tijāni, known as ʿUmar Falke (d. 1962) which resides at the Melville J. Herskovits Library of African Studies. While a portion of the manuscripts in the Falke collection were authored by Falke himself, it is important to bear in mind that he was a bibliophile and collector of manuscripts and the items in the boxes from which this selection of fāʾidahs were drawn should not be assumed to have been written by or used by Falke.
