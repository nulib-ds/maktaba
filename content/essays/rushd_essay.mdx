ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥājj Ibrāhīm al-ʿAlawī, known as Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh was a scholar from the town of Tijikja in the Southwestern Saharan region of Tagānt who contributed to the explosion of Saharan intellectual production in the eighteenth century. He was particularly known for his scholarship in jurisprudence (*fiqh*), the sayings of the Prophet Muḥammad (hadith), and the Arabic language, especially rhetoric (*ʿilm al-bayān*). After a period of study in the Sahara, Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh moved to Fez and lived there for ten years before travelling to Cairo and then to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage, and finally returning to his hometown where he died in 1817-1818.[^2]

While the Tagānt is today located in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, during Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh's lifetime it fell under the control of a group of Sanhaja Berbers known as the Idaw ʿIsh.[^3] ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥājj Ibrāhīm was known as "al-ʿAlawī" because he was a member of the Idaw ʿAlī, a group of Sanhaja Berbers who claimed to descend from ʿAli, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muḥammad.[^4] During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh lived, the upper ranks of Saharan society were divided (at least in theory) into "warrior" (*hassan*) groups who held political and military power and "clerical" (*zawāya*) groups who acquired learning and provided religious services. In this fashion, members of the Idaw ʿAlī acted as advisors and provided legal contracts and other services to the ruling Idaw ʿIsh.[^5]

Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh was embroiled in the major debates of his day, particularly those concerning the sciences of the unseen (*ʿilm al-ghayb*) and the authority of the friends of God (*awliyāʾ*). In eighteenth-century North-West Africa, the friends of God were individuals whose piety was thought to endear them to God and bring them closer to Him. People often sought out the living friends of God, or visited their tombs, to seek their blessings or to ask them to intercede with God on their behalf. Communities of Sufis gathered around teachers to recite prayers handed down from renowned friends of God and to perform certain devotional practices. For many, the purpose of these practices was to lead them through a series of spiritual states and stations on the path to God. Sufi teachers might lead their students in practices meant to evoke these spiritual states. One such practice, known as *dhikr*, which literally means "remembrance," involved gathering as a group to recite the names of God and other devotional phrases.

Being a Sufi was a complex identity, and like Sufis around the world, Sufis of West Africa occupied many different social roles. While some led communities of devotees in spiritual practices, others were itinerant wanderers, and still others were educated as scholars and composed written works in Arabic. Sufi scholars were associated with specific genres of literature, including reflections on cosmology and metaphysics.[^6] Sufi reflections on cosmology, metaphysics, and their focus on spiritual states associated them with the realm of the unseen (*al-ghayb*), the vast invisible world thought to surround and permeate the visible world. The heavens, populated by angels, and with God at their heart, composed part of this invisible world. The realm of the unseen was also inhabited by devils (*shayāṭīn*) and the Devil (*al-shayṭān*) as well as the *jinn*, a race of beings referred to in the Qurʾān who, like humans, could be either unbelievers or believing Muslims.[^7] As early as the ninth century, Muslims writing in Arabic had begun outlining various "sciences" that allowed people to manipulate the realm of the unseen to produce tangible effects on the visible world, for example by controlling angels or the *jinn*, exorcising devils, or crafting talismans, and these practices were widely debated within Muslim societies.[^8]

In the eighteenth-century Sahara, the practice of visiting the friends of Gods and their shrines and asking for their intercession with God had become particularly controversial, as was any involvement with the sciences of the unseen. In his didactic poem, *The Guide for the Heedless* (*Rushd al-Ghāfil*), Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh establishes his position on these issues. He rejects almost all of the sciences of the unseen as prohibited in Islamic law and classifies them as sorcery (*siḥr*); however, he also establishes himself as a Sufi by defending the practice of *dhikr*.

When Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh discusses the sciences of the unseen, he uses technical terms to refer to specific practices that were known and debated by Saharan Muslims. He thus refers to deploying the secret and revealed names of God and drawing on the hidden properties (*khawāṣṣ*) of objects. The terms "adjurations (*ʿaẓāʾim*)" and "evocations (*istikhdamāt*)" indicated different ways of binding unseen entities to someone's service. The adjurations referred to the practice of binding the angels by employing their names or powerful words, while evocations involved offering gifts of incense and clothes to the *jinn* or the spirits of the planets. Talismans were created by drawing the power of the planets or celestial spheres into an object. In this case the material of the talisman had to be aligned with the properties of the corresponding planet or celestial sphere. Meanwhile, powerful charts or tables were called "forms" (*ashkāl*) and could be inscribed onto paper, drinking bowls, or even the walls of homes. Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh also refers to various divinatory techniques, such as reading astrological birth charts, seeing omens in claps of thunder, or casting the shoulder blades of animals (scalpomancy). One practice, called sand writing (*khaṭṭ al-raml*), involved casting a series of lines in the sand that were thought to be connected to the movement of the stars.

While some of these techniques can be loosely rendered in English, others defy translation. For example, *hīmiyyā*, *sīmiyyā*, and *ruqiyya* are all technical terms that lack correspondences in English and for which Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh (and other Saharan scholars) provide only vague definitions. Thus, *hīmiyyā* is said to draw on celestial properties and *sīmiyyā* to make use of earthly properties, while *ruqiyya* was a much-debated practice that drew on the power of recited speech.[^9] A *sughniyya* or *sallāla* referred to a blood-sucking sorcerer and by the eighteenth century, tales of such vampires had become associated with developing racial categories in the desert. Thus, this form of sorcery was often attributed to populations that were considered black.[^10]

*The Guide for the Heedless* is a didactic, metrical poem (*naẓm*) of sixty-four lines. Each line is broken into two hemi-stitches, which rhyme with each other. In order to preserve the rhyme scheme Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh often changes the expected order of words in a phrase, for example by placing the verbs at the end of sentences. In my translation, I have tried to preserve a sense of rhyme and often do so by inverting typical word order, just as Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh did. In the copy of the poem found in the Boutilimit Collection, the poem is broken into sections, each with its own section header. I believe these headers to have been added by the copyist, as there is no indication of them in the commentary. I have not included them in the translation as they repeat lines and phrases awkwardly. I have, however, added additional space between lines where the subject of the poem shifts.

As a didactic poem, *The Guide for the Heedless* was not meant to stand on its own; rather, it was intended as a memorizable summary which Sīdī ʿAbd Allāḥ expanded on in a separate commentary (*sharḥ*). The commentary explains the poem line-by-line, and many references in the poem only fully make sense when read alongside these explanations. I have occasionally translated *The Guide for the Heedless* in ways that reflect Sīdī ʿAbd Allāh's clarifications in the commentary. However, in some cases the explanation is too long or complex to translate into the poem without deeply altering the original. I advise the reader not to be too concerned by ambiguous references in the poem, but rather to approach it as an Arabic speaker would, as an invitation to further study.
