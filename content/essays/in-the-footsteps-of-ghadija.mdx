# In the Footsteps of Ghadīja bt. al-ʿĀqil, African Logicians on the Moods and Figures of the Combinatorial Syllogism
## An Introduction to *Question on the Science of Logic (Masʾala Manṭiqiyya)*

The anonymous manuscript, *Question on the Science of Logic*,[^1] considers a specific issue (*mas'ala*) in logic: the order of combinatorial syllogisms.[^2] The manuscript was microfilmed under the direction of Charles Stewart at the family library of Shaykh Sīdiyyā[^3] (d. 1868) in the small city of Boutilimit, in the Trārza province of today's Islamic Republic of Mauritania.

Scholars of northwest Africa have occupied themselves for centuries--in poetry and prose--with copying manuscripts, and then adding notes or comments on the margins of the page. Yet paper has often been sparse and expensive in this region. Local or not, only the work of a venerated scholar, a recognized authority, is likely to be lavished with the scribe's trained hand and painstaking attention, or other precious resources. A scribe endorses a scholar's authority just by reading and copying works, and thus perpetuating them. But this is not close to all. The page of a manuscript often conceals its maker's artful management of space, already envisioned before the first drop of ink falls. This is the page's "interior design." Dividing the page into distinct spaces, the scribe may assign distinct geometric shapes to each space, before tracing letters and words that will draw the readers' attention from the design choices of the scribe. In this way, the "voice" of one scholar may be represented in rectangular form and occupy the center of the page; another scholar may also be "seen" and "heard" in this way, but often from a position of disadvantage: from the margins, at an angle, taking shape in the reduced space of an off-balance triangle. Just so, the design of space on the page may memorialize a hierarchy or a dispute between two scholars and their ideas. It remains equally within the domain of a manuscript to play host to ideas, regions, voices that have rarely, if ever, met before.[^4] The letters of the words traced in ink--say of plant resin or charcoal--represent an absent speaker's voice. Yet it is the design of space on the page of the manuscript that calls forth multiple voices and sets them in conversation.

On just one face of one leaf of paper, *Question on the Science of Logic* embodies this tradition of conviviality in the realm of ideas. The manuscript achieves this with a compressed treatment of the divergence between North and West African scholars as regards the order they assign to the combinatory syllogisms of logic. The single sheet (or folio) of the manuscript is written in the Shinqīṭī/Ṣaḥrāwī[^5] script. It contains no colophon.[^6] The lines of the first two-thirds of the page are in two columns, and the lines of the last third resemble a rectangle. At the edges of these two columns are three marginal corrections, and one addition of a scholar's name for clarity and completeness.

Shaykh Sīdiyyā was an avid collector of books and manuscripts like this one. Some of these were copied by hand on wooden tablets, leather, or costly imported paper. Some had been printed using tiny stones carved into the shape of Arabic letters, in cities such as Fez and Cairo, which West African scholars have long visited on their journeys of commerce, education, and pilgrimage. The encyclopedic range of titles in the Shaykh's library supported his authority as a scholar (*ʿālim*, *ʿallāma*) with broad knowledge of the Islamic sciences. A well-deserved reputation for learning gave Sīdiyyā the ability to arbitrate between, and provide guidance to, rulers and the populace alike. Most especially, Sīdiyyā took knowledge and cultivated a following among the Jakanī lineages of the Ḥawḍ to his east, as well as Daymānī lineages neighboring him in the Gebla, the Trārza region of the southwestern most Sahara where the desert meets the Senegal River. This helps explain the special prominence the anonymous manuscript gives to two Daymānī scholars, Aḥmad b. al-ʿĀqil (d. 1827) and Maḥanḍ (Muḥanḍ) Bāba b. Aʿbayd (d. 1860-1).[^7]

Aḥmad learned logic from his sister, Ghadīja bt. al-ʿĀqil[^8] (d. ca. 1835), who in Aḥmad's time was a (perhaps *the*) leading authority on logic in the Gebla. Reportedly, Ghadīja also taught the grammarian al-Mukhtār b. Būna al-Jakanī (henceforth Ibn Būna) (d. 1805), as well as ʿAbd al-Qādir Kān (d. 1807), who founded a new Islamic state in Futa Toro to the southeast, on both sides of the Senegal River. One of Ibn Būna's students, Ḥurma b. ʿAbd al-Jalīl[^9] (d. 1827), was in turn the teacher of Shaykh Sīdiyyā in logic[^10] and other sciences.[^11] Each of these scholars was a polymath, and command of logic was instrumental to his or her exercise of sacred authority.

The manuscript begins in the upper right-hand column with nineteen valid *moods* of the *combinatorial syllogism* in four *figures*.[^12] The combinatorial syllogism is an argument in which two sentences, known as *premises*, are given as reasons for a third sentence, *the conclusion*.[^13] An argument is *valid* if the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true. In each of the three sentences that make up a basic combinatorial syllogism, two *terms* are connected with the verb "to be" to form one sentence. Each term in the syllogism is repeated once, bringing the total number of terms to three. The *middle term* is the term that appears in both the premises, but not in the conclusion. The *minor term* and the *major term* both appear once in the premises and once in the conclusion. The *minor premise* is the sentence with the minor term; the *major premise* is the sentence with the major term. The minor premise appears first in *Question on the Science of Logic*, the major premise second.[^14]

In each of the three sentences that make up the syllogism, some (or all) of the first term, *the subject*, are said to be (or are said not to be) "true" as a statement about the second term, *the predicate*.[^15] Each sentence is affirmative or negative, and universal or particular. If affirmative and universal, the sentence is called an *A proposition* (A).[^16] If affirmative and particular, (I).[^17] If negative and universal, (E).[^18] If negative and particular, (O).[^19]

Each *figure* of the syllogism[^20] can be identified by where the middle term is located in the premises. The middle term is bolded in the following example of a second-figure syllogism:

Minor Premise: Some logicians are not **women**. (O)

Major Premise: All matriarchs are **women**. (A)

Conclusion: Some logicians are not matriarchs. (O)

In the example above, the middle term is the predicate in both premises. The subject of the minor premise is the minor term. The minor term is also the subject of the conclusion. The subject of the major premise is the major term. The major term is also the predicate of the conclusion. Logicians call this syllogism *valid*, because if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. Appendix A shows the rules for the placement of the middle term in each of the four figures. Following each rule is an example from philosophical theology for one of the four figures of the syllogism which Ghadīja bt. al-ʿĀqil gives in her *Marginal Commentary* (*Ṭurra*)[^21] on *al-Sullam* of al-Akhḍarī.[^22]

The anonymous author gives the nineteen valid syllogisms in the order found in *al-Zawāhir* of al-Hilālī[^23] and the commentary of al-Bannānī[^24] on *al-Sullam* by al-Akhḍarī. (S)he then adds two long explanatory notes, in the upper left-hand two-thirds of the page, and in the lower one-third of the page, respectively. In the first note, the author contrasts the order of valid syllogisms given by (1) al-Hilālī and al-Bannānī, against the list given by (2) both al-Akhḍarī[^25] and by Qaddūra,[^26] against the list given by (3) Aḥmad b. al-ʿĀqil[^27] and Maḥand Bāba.[^28]

The differences between (1), (2), and (3) reflect distinctive local and textual traditions each logician trained with, but also reflect differing ways of understanding what makes an argument clear and powerful, and what ways of teaching and applying the syllogism are clearest and most useful. In the second note, at the end of the page, the author points out that in each case, each pair provides its own distinct ordering of the valid syllogisms: (1) al-Hilālī's list agrees with al-Bannānī's, (2) al-Akhḍarī agrees with Qaddūra, and (3) Aḥmad b. al-ʿĀqil with Maḥand Bāba. The first pair were based in today's Morocco, the second pair in today's Algeria, and the third pair in today's Mauritania, before the establishment of today's national borders. What the *Question on the Science of Logic* depicts, in other words, is a debate between regional schools of logic, in which the logicians of the Senegal River basin appear on an independent and equal footing to better-known logicians north of the Sahara. Moreover, the order of syllogisms agreed upon by Aḥmad b. al-ʿĀqil and Maḥanḍ Bāba already precedes them, for their position here is just that of Aḥmad's own sister and teacher, Ghadīja bt. al-ʿĀqil al-Daymāniyya.

### Appendix A: Rules for the Placement of the Middle Term in the Four Figures

*Note that the middle term has been bolded for clarity*.

In the first figure, the middle term is the predicate of the minor premise, and is the subject of the major premise.

> Example:
>
> Some substantial entities are **bodies**. (I)
>
> All **bodies** are susceptible to change. (A)
>
> → Some substantial entities are susceptible to change. (I)

In the second figure, the middle term is the predicate in both premises.

> Example:
>
> Some attributes are **susceptible to change**. (I)
>
> Nothing eternal is **susceptible to change**. (E)
>
> → Some attributes are not eternal. (O)

In the third figure, the middle term is the subject in both premises.

> Example:
>
> All **bodies** are susceptible to change. (A)
>
> All **bodies** are originating in time. (A)
>
> → Some things susceptible to change are originating in time.[^29] (I)

In the fourth figure, the middle term is the subject of the minor premise, and is the predicate in the minor premise.

Example:

> Some (things) **susceptible to change** are attributes. (I)
>
> Nothing eternal is **susceptible to change**. (E)
>
> → Some attributes are not eternal.[^30] (O)

[^2]: In its most basic sense, a "syllogism" is the joining of a conclusion with the grounds ("premises") for accepting that conclusion. Many "syllogisms" follow a regular pattern that can be applied in new and unfamiliar situations, once their pattern is learned. The most common is the "combinatorial" syllogism, which combines not less than two terms in one statement, and again in a second statement; a third statement, the conclusion, is the result of combining the first and the second statement.

[^3]: His full name, as it appears in Charles C. Stewart with Sidi Ahmed Wuld Ahmed Salim, *Arabic Literature of Africa*, vol. 5, pt. 1, *The Writings of Mauritania and the Western Sahara* (henceforth ALA 5) (Leiden: Brill, 2016), 133, is Sīdiyyā b. al-Mukhtār b. al-Hayba al-Abyayri al-Intishāʾī.

[^4]: I have taken much inspiration from my friend Muḥammadhin's manner of observing Mauritanian manuscripts.

[^8]: ALA 5 records her name as Khadīja bint Muḥammad al-ʿĀqil al-Abhamiyya ad-Daymāniyya (451). We prefer to use "Ghadīja," the name her family uses in writings about her.

[^11]: If both relationships are as described in early biographical sources, Shaykh Sīdiyyā was thus the student of Ghadīja's student, Ibn Būna. Curiously, the latter does not appear in the *Question on the Science of Logic*, despite his having written a commentary of his own on *al-Sullam* (Institut Mauritanienne de Recherche Scientifique, MS 1145), as well as at least one other work on logic, the widely circulating *Ṭuhfat al-Muḥaqqiq*.

[^12]: Five other valid moods of the combinatorial syllogism can be derived from these nineteen, bringing the total to twenty-four valid moods. Of the other 256 possible combinations of universal or affirmative, positive or negative sentences, all are invalid.

[^13]: The combinatorial syllogism is sometimes also known as the categorical syllogism. Logicians distinguish this syllogism from other kinds, such as hypothetical syllogism. Only the combinatorial is treated in the *Question of the Science of Logic*.

[^14]: We follow the manuscript here in presenting the minor premise first, and the major premise second. Prior to 1880, if your Arabic was better than your Latin, you probably placed the premises in this order; if your Latin was better than your Arabic, you probably placed the major premise first. The past is a different country, and these generalizations are now less applicable. Still, most presentations of the syllogism in English today put the major premise first.

[^15]: If some or all As are said to be Bs, the statement is affirmative. If some or all As are said not to be Bs, the statement is negative. In this essay and in my translation of the manuscript, I have opted to use the letters AEIO as abbreviations for the propositions, following a Western convention.

[^16]: An example of a universal affirmative sentence: "All contracts are consensual." (A)

[^17]: Particular affirmative: "Some contracts are exploitative." (I)

[^18]: Universal negative: "No usury is ethical." (E)

[^19]: Particular negative: "Some almsgivers are not scholars." (O)

[^20]: Logicians disagree on the number of the figures of the categorical syllogism. Most early Arabic logicians, up to and including Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā: d. 1037), recognized three figures. In later centuries, recognition of four figures became more common.

Ibn Ṭayyib's *Jawāhir* is studied in Mauritania under the title of *al-Ṭayyibiyya* by more advanced students of logic, and is mentioned below, as is Maḥanḍ Bāba's marginal commentary (*Ṭurra*) on the same (line 9 and thereafter).
