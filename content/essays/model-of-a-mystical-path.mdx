What started as a letter Shaykh Ibrāhīm Niasse (d. 1975) wrote in Arabic to his disciple ʿUmar Touré in the rural hamlet of Kosi in colonial Senegal back in 1931 has, almost one-hundred years later, developed into one of the foundational religious texts of a global Sufi community. One of the foremost leaders of the Tijānīyya Sufi order and among the most prominent Muslim scholars of twentieth-century Africa, Niasse authored numerous works in Arabic that cover the whole range of Islamic sciences.[^1] Among them is *The Three Stations of Religion*[^2] (as the 1931 letter is commonly called), a short treatise that attained a wide readership among the members of his community. Initially only circulating in a few manuscript copies, the text is nowadays easily available in print and only a few mouse clicks away on the Internet, whether in Arabic, English, or French.[^3]

The Tijānī branch Niasse established was initially known as the "Community of the Divine Flood" (*jamā*ʿ*at al-fayḍa*). Largely limited to West Africa at the time of his death, the movement later spread to other parts of Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Some estimates put the number of his followers at one-hundred million or more.[^4] In any case, there can be no doubt that the *fayḍa* branch of the Tijānīyya is nowadays among the most dynamic Sufi movements worldwide.

One of the major reasons for the movement's popularity lies in its approach to Sufism and divine knowledge. Ibrāhīm Niasse developed a method of spiritual training (*tarbiya*) that effectively functioned as a shortcut to mystical knowledge.[^5] Accounts by his followers emphasize that this method not only allowed for faster progress on the mystical path, but also led to more intense spiritual experiences. As divine knowledge can only be experienced and cannot be fully expressed in words, written expositions of the subject have their limitations in what they are able to convey. Still, Sufis have developed models designed to structure the journey on the mystical path and put them in writing, sometimes in the form of voluminous handbooks. These writings were not meant for use in the training of their disciples, but for the purpose of developing what came to be known as "the science of Sufism" (*ʿilm al-taṣawwuf*).[^6] Niasse's *Three Stations of Religion*, even if very brief and much less ambitious, falls into the category of such writings. Yet, other than the often convoluted works that remained the preserve of a few religious scholars, this short treatise was instrumental in spreading and popularizing Niasse's teachings about the mystical journey and experiential knowledge of God, not least because it lent itself more easily to oral transmission in vernacular languages.

The "three stations" of the work's title refer to *islām* (submission), *imān* (faith), and *iḥsān* (excellence), which are divided into stages that aspirants on the mystical path must traverse under the supervision of a qualified master. They are fundamental to *tarbiya* as articulated by Niasse. At the beginning of the text, Niasse says that he wrote the treatise in response to a request by ʿUmar b. Mālik (known as ʿUmar Touré, as introduced above), who had inquired about the three stations after he was unable to distill concise information from an earlier work introduced by the short title *al-Mīzāb* ("The Water Spout").[^7] Written by ʿUbayda b. Anbūja (d. 1867), a well-known scholar and Tijānī shaykh from Tichit in present-day Mauritania, the *Mīzāb* is a manual on spiritual training with lengthy expositions on the stages of the path and the prayer formulas used during the journey. Niasse's treatise can be described as an abridged version of the *Mīzāb*. However, neither text includes concrete instructions as to how precisely this training is to be conducted. Such details are only conveyed directly from the master to the disciple and not supposed to be put in writing.

Just as Niasse does not claim the copyright for the tripartite model expounded in *The Three Stations of Religion*, Ibn Anbūja also gives credit to another author, in this instance a fourteenth-century Sufi authority from Andalusia: the stations (*maqāmāt*) and abodes (*manāzil*) outlined in the *Mīzāb* were adapted from a work titled *Bughyat al-Sālik fī Ashraf al-Masālik* by Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Sāḥilī (d.1355).[^8] Yet, the origins of this tripartite structure even go back to the time of the Prophet Muḥammad, as the names of the three stations are derived from the famous "*Ḥadīth* of Gabriel."[^9] In this account, a stranger approached the Prophet while he was surrounded by some of his Companions. The stranger asked the Prophet three consecutive questions: What is *islām*, what is *īmān*, and what is *iḥsān*? In response to the first question, the Prophet referred to the five Pillars of Islam. The answer to the second question consisted of the fundamental articles of faith (*ʿaqāʾid*; belief in God, his angels, his messengers, all heavenly books, and the divine decree and predestination). In response to the last question, the Prophet said: "*Iḥsān* means that you worship God as if you see Him. Even if you do not see Him, He sees you." After the stranger left, the Prophet--who had recognized that he was no other than the angel Gabriel, the transmitter of the Qurʾanic revelations--disclosed the latter's identity to his Companions and told them that Gabriel had come to teach them their religion.

Since then, many branches of the Islamic sciences, most notably theology and jurisprudence,[^10] have taken up the distinction between *islām*, *īmān*, and *iḥsān*, which is therefore far from being the prerogative of the Sufis. Still, the understanding that Sufism represents the supreme station of excellence and the notion that the mystical journey proceeds in stages are prevalent in virtually all Sufi traditions and inform Niasse's approach to and practice of spiritual training.

Figure 1 gives an overview of the model of the mystical path as summarized in the *The Three Stations of Religion*. As can be seen, each of the stations (submission, faith, excellence) is in turn divided into three abodes, derived from ʿUbayda b. Anbūja's *Mīzāb* and ultimately from Abū ʿAbdallāh al-Sāḥilī's *Bughyat al-Sālik*.

**Figure 1: The Three Stations of Religion (according to Ibrāhīm Niasse**[^11]**)**
|                                   | **Three *Maqāmāt* / Stations** |                             |
| :-------------------------------  | :----------------------------  | :-------------------------  |         
|    ***islām* / submission**       |     ***īmān* / faith**         |    ***iḥsān* / excellence** |
|                                   |                                |                             |
|                                   | **Nine *Manāzil* / Abodes** |                                |                                                                                         
|   1\. *tawba* / repentance        | 4\. *ṣidq* / truthfulness  | 7\. *murāqaba* / contemplation  |                                                                                                       |
|  2\. *istiqāma* / righteousness   |  5\. *ikhlāṣ* / sincerity  |  8\. *mushāhada* / witness      |                                                         
|  3\. *taqwā* / God-consciousness  |  6\. *ṭumaʾnīna* / serenity|     9\. *maʿrifa* / cognizance  |


What lends Niasse's systematization its peculiar character compared to the previous models is the differentiation of further levels in the first six abodes: each of these has distinctive exigencies, depending on the spiritual status of the traveler on the path. Niasse distinguishes the common people (*al-ʿāmm*), the elite (*al-khāṣṣa*), and the elite of the elite (*khāṣṣat al-khāṣṣa*). Aspirants who reach the sixth abode have attained elite status, and from the eighth abode onwards (i.e., *mushāhada* or witnessing, considered the doorstep to realizing mystical knowledge), the distinction between elite and elite of the elite status also subsides. In other words, the journey does not simply proceed from the first abode of the first stage to the last abode of the third, but may consist of iterations, whereby the aspirants start over in the lower abodes and traverse them again, this time with elite or elite of the elite status, and with an ever-increasing depth of the spiritual experience.

Among the noteworthy aspects of the model, as Niasse presents it, is the way in which he connects the three stages to the nine presences (*ḥaḍarāt*) of Tijānī cosmology, thus emphasizing a Sufi stance that evokes the teachings of Ibn al-*ʿ*Arabī (d. 1240).[^12] A similar mystical outlook is also inherent in the depiction of the gradual extinction of the aspirant's self during the journey to divine knowledge. Arriving at cognizance, the last abode, is tantamount to losing any perception other than God's. This is further illustrated in the short appendix of the treatise, where Niasse gives his own brief definition of the "reality" of each of the abodes by foregrounding the aspirant's immersion in the omnipresence of God, until nothing remains in existence other than God.

At the same time, Niasse is careful to relate each of his definitions to references from the Qurʾan, with a total of sixteen Qurʾan quotations appearing in the appendix alone. The same number of quotes from the Qurʾan is included in the foregoing exposition of the three stages and nine abodes. These references are indicative of Niasse's endeavor to anchor his exposition in the Divine Revelation, which ultimately inspires and justifies the Sufi teachings he puts forward.

As a widely influential Sufi text, *The Three Stations of Religion* illustrates the century-long Islamic intellectual connections that spanned West Africa, the Maghreb, and the Middle East. Beyond attesting to the understanding and implementation of Sufi teachings and practices in West African contexts, it also offers an outstanding example of a handwritten letter that eventually became an integral part of the canon of a worldwide religious community.
