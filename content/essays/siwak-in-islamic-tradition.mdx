This poem[^1] by an unknown author provides instruction in the proper use of the *siwāk*[^2]--a teeth cleaning stick typically made from a twig of the *Salvadora persica,* a tree known for its antimicrobial properties. These natural toothbrushes have been used throughout the Arabo-Muslim world since antiquity to clean and whiten the teeth. What is less well-known is that the use of the *siwāk* in Muslim societies is regulated by strict and precise rules. The poem enumerates these rules, extols the *siwāk*'s benefits*, and warns of the perils improper use. This "user's manual" in thirty-five verses not only imparts practical information about oral hygiene but also reinforces the virtues of following the example of the Prophet Muḥammad.

Known as the arak tree in Arabic, *Salvadora persica* is a small evergreen found in arid environments in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Its use by Babylonians some seven thousand years ago has been documented, and it continues to be studied for its therapeutic effects.[^3] To make a *siwāk*, one cuts a twig from the tree, peels the bark from the end and chews it until the fibers become soft and can be rubbed against the teeth. A 2016 study determined that the *siwāk* contains "more than 10 natural occurring constituents essential for maintaining good oral and general health."[^4]

*Poem on the Use of the Siwāk* is framed as a response to a question from a young man who has asked the author, presumably a Muslim scholar, "about the status of the *siwāk* and what *fiqh*[^5] has decided on this subject." The author praises the questioner for asking "the best of questions" about "the essential points of Religion." This framing makes it clear that what follows is a didactic poem, a sub-genre of Arabic poetry meant to teach about a particular subject.[^6] The rhyming verses of didactic poetry facilitate memorization, which in turn allows knowledge to be preserved and transmitted orally.[^7] Because they are meant for instruction and learning, manuscript versions of didactic poems often have a plain appearance, lacking attractive calligraphy, colors, and decorative features. This is certainly true for the copy of *Poem on the Use of the Siwāk* appearing in *Maktaba*, which is written in a plain, unembellished handwriting and laid out with somewhat uneven column widths.[^8]

The need to transmit knowledge about the use of the *siwāk* reflects the importance of purification practices in Islam. Muslims follow strict procedures, governed by *fiqh*, for cleansing the body as preparation for prayer. Indeed, the first section in *fiqh* manuals is always about purification (*ṭahāra*).[^9] Cleaning the teeth with the *siwāk*, according to the method established by the Prophet Muḥammad,[^10] is a recommended component of pre-prayer cleansing. Early in the poem the author introduces the five cases in which *fiqh* especially recommends use of the *siwāk*: in connection with prayer, ablution, recitation of the Qurʾan, after sleep, and when the breath has lost its freshness (for example, after a long silence).[^11] The author enumerates other appropriate times to use the *siwāk* (after having eaten or entered a home) and times one should not (when defecating, urinating, or lying on one's back). The poem also describes the precise technique for fashioning and using the *siwāk*: the type of wood, the length of the twig, and how to hold it properly.

Some health benefits of the *siwāk* are also mentioned, including bringing a shine to the eyes, decreasing phlegm, slowing the process of aging, increasing energy, and protecting against leprosy (if the saliva generated during the first use of the *siwāk* of the day is swallowed). Using it improperly, the poem cautions, can damage the eyes and cause jaundice. References to phlegm (*balgham*), bile (*al-mirra*), and jaundice (*al-sufra*) reflect the influence of ancient Greco-Roman medicine--namely the humoral theory articulated by Hippocrates (5th c. BC) and Galen (d. 59 BC), whose ideas profoundly influenced the development of "classical" Islamic medicine between the ninth and twelfth century. According to this theory, the human body contains four vital bodily fluids (humors): blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. An imbalance in any of them could cause disease or behavioral disorders.[^12] While classical Islamic medicine deriving authority from Greco-Roman sources did not become the dominant medical paradigm in Muslim West Africa,[^13] where this poem was presumably written, references to the humors can nevertheless be found in manuscripts from the region.[^14]

While there are some prose works that deal with the *siwāk* independently, poetic compositions about the *siwāk* are not common. Rare examples are two poems, the first attributed to Egyptian scholar Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī (d.1449) and the second to Abū Bakr b. Aḥmed b. Qāsim al-Ahdal (d. 1626). In the region of the Islamic West--that is, the Maghreb and West Africa--there are some poems that mention the *siwāk* in the context of the virtues of ablution, fasting, and the etiquette of reciting the Qurʾan. *Poem on the Use of the Siwāk*, however, is the only known poem from this region exclusively on the topic of the *siwāk*.

The manuscript contains no author attribution nor date of composition, which is typical of didactic poetry. Based upon the paper, it likely dates from the late nineteenth century. In addition to the copy displayed in *Maktaba*, which comes from a collection in Kano, Nigeria, research has turned up three additional copies of the poem. One is in a private library in Ilorin--a town in the predominantly Yoruba western region of Nigeria that was part of the nineteenth century Sokoto caliphate and an important center of Islamic learning.[^15] The second is in the Mamma Haidara Library, originally in Timbuktu, Mali, also dating from the nineteenth century.[^16] The third is in the library of Sayyid ʿAbd al-Wāfī al-Ghātī in the city of Ghadames, in the far west of Libya. The owner of this copy, al-Ghātī, has reproduced (in typescript Arabic) nineteen verses of the poem online.[^17] There are slight differences between the Kano, Timbuktu, and Ghadames versions. The Timbuktu version, for example, includes four verses that are not in the Kano version, discussing the *siwāk*'s benefits for sexual intercourse, hair growth, and improved appearance of the skin. It also addresses the harm of throwing a *siwāk* on the ground and then using it, using a *siwāk* in a house other than one's own, or throwing a *siwāk* away in a mosque. The presence of copies of the same poem in these four locations supports the idea of West African authorship, mostly likely from the region covered by present-day Nigeria, Niger, or Mali. Strong cultural and commercial links have connected Ghadames over the centuries to sub-Saharan Africa--Kano and Timbuktu in particular--so it is not surprising that a copy would be found in Ghadames. The presence of many Nigerian manuscripts in Ghadames libraries is evidence of the spread of the writings of Nigerian scholars to this region.

For now, this poem's origin story is unknown, as are the routes it travelled to end up in libraries in at least four African locations. The existence of multiple manuscript copies of a given text in different, often far-flung, locales, is a common feature of the manuscript culture of West Africa. It reflects the personal and peripatetic nature of Islamic learning in this context, where students travelled to seek instruction in specific subjects with teachers throughout the region and beyond. Because much of the instruction took place in teachers' homes, most Muslim scholars of importance built up private libraries from which visiting students would make copies of texts to return home with.[^18] Designed to educate young people about the rituals and duties of Islam, *Poem on the Use of the Siwāk* reveals the pedagogical techniques used by Muslim scholars to maintain their religious communities across space and time and transmit knowledge between generations.

[^10]: In Muslim societies, there is a strong association between the *siwāk* and the Prophet Muḥammad; numerous *ḥadīths* (actions or sayings of the Prophet Muḥammad) narrate the Prophet's use of the *siwāk* and his encouragement of others to use it.

[^12]: Many Greco-Roman medical texts had been translated into Arabic by the ninth century and provided a framework for medical practice and theory in the Islamic world from roughly the ninth to twelfth century. Muslim physicians systematized and elaborated on the Greco-Roman concepts and wrote their own medical texts in Arabic. Chief among them was Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAbd Allah ibn Sīnā, (c. 1037) known in Europe as "Avicenna." Ibn Sīnā was born in Central Asia, traveled through much of the Islamic world, and wrote at least 270 different treatises on medicine and philosophy.

[^13]: On the difference between "classical Islamic medicine" (based on Greek knowledge) and "Prophetic medicine," in which advice on sickness, treatment, and hygiene are sought in the example of the Prophet Muḥammad, see Ismail H. Abdalla, *Islam, Medicine, and Practitioners in Northern Nigeria* (Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 1977). Abdalla concludes that classical Islamic medicine did have much impact on Hausaland, the subject of his monograph (69). Nonetheless, works by Ibn Sīnā can be found in libraries in Timbuktu. For example, a copy of his *al-Urjūza fi al-Ṭibb* (*Poem on Medicine*) is in the Aḥmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research (IHERI-AB) in Timbuktu.

[^15]: See John O. Hunwick, *Arabic Literature of Africa*, vol. 2, *The Writings of Central Sudanic Africa* (henceforth ALA 2) (Leiden: Brill, 1995): 461-3. Reference to the poem is on page 463: viii): "*Q\[aṣīda\] tāʾiyya* \[meaning that the final line of each hemistich rhymes with the letter tā\]...Anon., poem on the rules of *fiqh* regarding the tooth-stick (*siwāk*)." The first line of the poem reproduced in ALA 2 is identical to first line of the Kano (*Maktaba*) copy. ALA 2 lists it in a collection created by Abū Bakr Al-Siddīq b. Salāḥ al-Dīn (known as Imam Agbarigidomo) of "Arabic poems written by different authors from Ilorin and Yorubaland, some by himself, some anonymous." While this suggests that the author is from Ilorin or Yorubaland further verification would be needed before reaching a conclusion about authorship. The fact that the collector, Imam Agbarigidomo, was affiliated with the Niassene branch of the Tijāniyya in Kano makes it possible that his version of the poem was copied from the Kano version.
