*Ijāza* literally means "authorization," "permission," or "license," and normally refers to a document that certifies the competence of the possessor to transmit a certain type of knowledge.[^1] The origin of the *ijāza* system is found in the practice of early Muslim scholars seeking to collect reports on the deeds or sayings of the Prophet Muḥammad (*ḥadīth*) and to obtain from eyewitnesses the permission to transmit them to others. This kind of knowledge transmission and verification, which is premised on the idea that face-to-face, individualized learning is paramount in maintaining the integrity of knowledge, was then applied to other fields.[^2] An *ijāza* normally comprises the *silsila*, or the "chain" of transmitters that connect the last recipient to the foundational figure at the apex of the transmitted knowledge, be it the Prophet in the case of *ḥadīths*, or, for instance, the author of a book in cases where an *ijāza* is a license to teach a given text or a specific practice.

*Ijāza*s[^3] also play an important role in the case of Muslim Sufi brotherhoods (*ṭarīqa*), those spiritual paths that developed around the teaching of prominent mystics.[^4] In this context, an *ijāza* is the act by which the religious leader or *shaykh*--whether the founder, the *khalīfa* (the founder's successor), or the *muqaddam* (an individual tasked with initiating novices)--authorizes a disciple who has climbed the brotherhood's ranks to teach and transmit the precepts, prayers, rites, and spiritual secrets to other disciples and to give him or her, in turn, the possibility of granting *ijāza* himself or herself.

In the Sufi context there are different types and "levels" of *ijāzas*. The most basic (*'āmma*) authorizes its holder to initiate disciples only into the fundamentals of the *ṭarīqa*: the set of *wirds* and *ḥizbs*--spiritual formulas and specific prayers--that must be recited a certain number of times per day or per week, individually and/or collectively, and are intended for the masses (*'awam*). The absolute (*muṭlaqa*), or full (*tāmma*), gives the recipient the right to initiate, study, and transmit esoteric knowledge as well as the secrets and mysteries (*asrār*) of the *ṭarīqa* and is intended for the elite (*khawāṣ*). Although there is no fixed "template" for an *ijāza*, it generally includes the following elements: the name of the person granting the *ijāza*, the name of the beneficiary, the type of *ijāza*, sometimes the reasons for choosing the beneficiary, and the details of what can or cannot be done in terms of transmission and teaching. Though typically written, an *ijāza* can be transmitted orally too.

The three documents presented here[^5] are examples of *ijāzas* of the Qādiriyya, one of the most important Sufi brotherhoods in the Muslim world. The Qādiriyya is among the oldest Sufi brotherhoods in Islamic history and traces its origins to a Sufi scholar of twelfth-century Baghdad, ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jilānī (d. 1166). After having spread in North Africa at an early stage, the Qādiriyya found its way into western Africa.[^6] Traditions that date the spread of the Qādiriyya to the sixteenth century are likely spurious.[^7] However, by the late eighteenth century the brotherhood started spreading in the region thanks to the peripatetic teaching of the foremost scholar of the Arabophone Kunta clan of the Saharan West, al-Mukhtār al-Kabīr (d. 1811).[^8] Al-Mukhtār al-Kabīr reformulated the brotherhood and became responsible for the unprecedented spread of the Qādiriyya in western Africa.

The three *ijāzas* presented here belonged to an influential Muslim scholar of the Saharan West, Shaykh Sīdiyyā (d. 1868).[^9] He was among the disciples of al-Mukhtār al-Kabīr, a member of the Awlād Abyayrī tribe from the northern shore of the middle course of the Senegal River in what is today's Mauritania. Born in 1775, he completed his study of the Qurʾan at the early age of thirteen with his mother, Maryama Barka. He then left his tribe to study with a famous teacher of the Idaw ʿAlī named Ḥurma b. ʿAbd al-Jalīl al-ʿAlawī. He spent seventeen years with this teacher, becoming an accomplished scholar and authoring his first work, a commentary on the didactic poem on grammar by Ibn Durayd (d. 933) called *al-Maqṣūra*. He then moved to study jurisprudence among the Djedjeba and specifically under Ḥabīb Allāh b. al-Qāḍī (d. c. 1815). At this stage of his career, at around thirty-five years of age, Shaykh Sīdiyyā finally moved to the Azawād, north of the Niger Bend, to study under al-Mukhtār al-Kabīr. Unfortunately, the Kunta scholar was close to death when Shaykh Sīdiyyā arrived; as a result he spent only five months with al-Mukhtār al-Kabīr before becoming mainly the student of his successor, Muḥammad al-Kuntī (d. 1826).[^10] With him, he furthered his studies in jurisprudence, which led him to become a prominent jurist and influential political figure once returned to the Gebla region after the death of Muḥammad al-Kuntī.

In the Kunta camp, Shaykh Sīdiyyā also studied Sufism and became initiated into the Qādiriyya, as the three *ijāzas* presented here demonstrate. The first[^11] was written by the son of Muḥammad al-Kuntī, al-Mukhtār al-Ṣaghīr (d. 1846), who would become the leader of the Kunta Qādiriyya in the region after his father's demise,[^12] and the other two[^13] by a rather obscure son of al-Mukhtār al-Kabīr, 'Umar. The three *ijāzas* granted to Shaykh Sīdiyyā are absolute, general and full, the same as those received by al-Mukhtār al-Kuntī, according to their authors. As such, they grant him the right to initiate aspirants into the entirety of the *wird*, *ḥizb*, and other prayers, as well as the secrets and mysteries of the *ṭarīqa*.
