Gum Arabic (*Acacia Senegalis*), a natural exudate of the acacia tree, played an important role in trading relationships between France and the inhabitants of the southwest of today's Mauritania during the precolonial era. *The First Covenant between* Idāb Lihsan *and the French* provides a brief narrative account of the beginning of the gum trade between local groups and French merchants. The document is written from the perspective of a member of one preeminent local clerical and merchant lineage, the *Idāb Liḥsan*, who figure in the manuscript in the Arabized form of *Banī al-Ḥasan*.[^2] As evidenced by the last sentence of the text, the objective of the anonymous writer seems to have been to push a claim of anteriority of his tribe's (*qabilā*) partnership with the French gum traders. This suggests that the document might have been penned in the context of some sort of competition or even conflict between local groups over the trade with external partners. It is not a coincidence that the writer mentions *Idaw al-Hājj*, a particularly dynamic merchant and clerical lineage (*zwāya*) whose powerful trade networks have long connected the northern parts of the Sahara to the northern parts of the Senegal River valley and the Atlantic coast.[^3] The mention in the manuscript of the presence of a scholar from *Idāb Liḥsan/Banī al-Ḥasan* among *Idaw al-Hājj*, the trading group known for its connections with foreign merchants, is meant to give this story more credibility. This document thus offers an illustration of how gum Arabic fostered political and commercial agreement between French traders and their local counterparts in the territory comprising present-day Mauritania. It further demonstrates that this commercial exchange was conducted with the authorization of an influential local warrior lineage, part of the *Banī Hassān* class, namely the Brākna.

French traders established their first commercial outposts on the coasts of western Africa in 1637, when they founded the city of Saint-Louis, located at the mouth of the Senegal River; and in 1677 when they took control of the island of Gorée, just off the Cape Verde peninsula. By the nineteenth century, France had become the major imperial actor in the region.[^4] The narrative imparted in *The first covenant between* Idāb Lihsan *and the French* concerns a period when French prevailed over other Europeans competitors, especially the British, for exclusive access to a strategic commodity--gum Arabic--that had been in high demand in Europe since at least the eighteenth century.[^5] By the time this document was written, economic relationships between French and local merchants had transformed substantially due to the enforcement of the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of "legitimate commerce."[^6] Trade in gum Arabic had become pivotal to French economic interests in the region.

Although gum Arabic from the region had been exported since the late seventeenth century, the external demand for this product grew exponentially in the first half of the nineteenth century, with its increased use in European textile and pharmaceutical industries.[^7] The extraction of gum Arabic was the result of the labor of slaves owned by *zwāya* clerical lineages of the Sahara, and this production was taxed by local *Banī* *Ḥassān* warrior lineages.[^8] The latter would also tax its export, handled by *zwāya* merchants, to the trading posts on the Senegal River, the so-called *escales*. Eventually, from the *escales*, local and mestizo middlemen would buy gum Arabic and carry it to Saint-Louis, where French traders would buy it and export it to Europe. This system increased the price of gum Arabic as French traders were increasingly subjected to the conditions posed by local traders and tribal chiefs. To alter the system and secure transactions in a volatile environment where opposing groups vied for control of the trade and the benefits it brought, French authorities sought to strengthen their military presence in the region. Attempts to achieve this goal in the 1840s failed, but the appointment of Louis L. C. Faidherbe (d. 1889) as Governor of Senegal set in motion the first massive campaign to push French territorial control along the Senegal River valley and even further eastward towards the Middle Niger.[^9]

The account in this manuscript refers to the early period of French interest in gum Arabic and to an alleged first encounter between French traders and this precious commodity. The goal of the writer, however, is clearly to establish the anteriority of the involvement of *Idāb Liḥsan* in the trade with the French. However, beyond the story, the account offers useful nuggets of information on the production and trade of gum Arabic as well as on the main actors of the trade: the French traders; the *zwāya* traders belonging to clerical lineages symbolized by the scholar Bin Maḥam b. Akhtīr; and the local warrior chief, Aghraysh of the Brākna, who receives a bonus ("*amkabbul*") and taxes as compensation for allowing the trade in gum Arabic to proceed undisturbed. The authorization and protection of the Brākna chief would have been essential in a context where small groups of *Banī Hassān* desert warriors lived off banditry and pillaging in and around the Senegal River valley. However, strikingly but understandably, the text does not mention that the collection of the precious commodity is the result of the labor of local black enslaved people. Given the local political economy and the structures of the social hierarchies in the region at the time, that probably went without saying.

[^2]: This should not be confused with *Banī Hassān*, which is the generic term used locally to refer to the entirety of the warrior tribes in the region. Scholarship and commerce are both the specialty of clerical groups while protection and security fall under the purview of warriors group such as the Brākna as mentioned in the manuscript.
