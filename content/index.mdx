## About Maktaba

_Maktaba_ is a collaborative effort between the Northwestern University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to make their unique West African manuscript holdings accessible to non-specialist audiences through a digital collection. The _Maktaba_ collection features images of twenty West African Arabic and Ajami manuscripts from the libraries of these two universities. Each manuscript is accompanied by a transcription into typescript Arabic, an English translation, and an introductory essay providing cultural and historical context.
