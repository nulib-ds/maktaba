His descriptions of the European conquest in this poem are more detailed and the commentary is bolder than the first colonial poem. He details the dismal performances of African soldiers facing the technological superiority of European colonial armies. The poem uses subtle and effective constructions to render these military encounters, narrating the conquest of over two hundred towns, territories, and ethnic groups. Al-Ḥājj ʿUmar did not conceal his outrage at the violence perpetrated by Europeans powers upon African peoples, and he represents the campaigns as unprovoked acts of inhumanity and savagery. Notable, too, is the poet's sense that colonial rule upended social hierarchies between nobles, commoners and slaves, resulting in the destruction of African societies. This second poem also highlights the deception of Europeans: they pretended to be respectful and interested only in commerce and preventing injustice and robbery across the lands, but they reneged on their promises during the conquest.

The change in al-Ḥājj ʿUmar's perspective on colonial rule in this poem, in contrast to the first two poems, is evident throughout. It is particularly clear in his closing satirical depiction of animals and birds: he changes the usual roles of aggressor and victim to underscore the reversal. Additional evidence of his different perspective are the poem's concluding lines: \\\"For my part, I am thankful to God, in their era for they have treated me well, these Christians.
