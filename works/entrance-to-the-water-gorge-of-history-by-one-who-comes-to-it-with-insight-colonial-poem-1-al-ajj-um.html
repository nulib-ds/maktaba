to the Water Gorge of History, by One Who Comes to it with Insight (Colonial Poem 1) (Al-Ḥajj ʿUmar of Kete-Krachi, d. 1934) - Maktaba","description":"The first of three “colonial poems” written over the span of a decade by an influential scholar of the Volta region (Ghana), describing the colonial conquest of West Africa by various European powers. Composed circa 1899, it includes a long list of places engulfed by the European military advance and closes with a soliloquy revealing the distress of these tumultuous times.
