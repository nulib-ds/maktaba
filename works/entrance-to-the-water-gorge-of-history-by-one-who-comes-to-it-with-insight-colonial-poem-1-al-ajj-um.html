According to this system, the letter *fā'* = 80 and the letter *zayn* = 7, totaling 87 verses. Probably the poet included the opening line (the *basmala*) in his counting of the verses.\n\n[^25]: Applying the *abjad* system to the verb *yushriqū* (\"has dawned\"), the author indicates the year of the poem's composition: 1316 or 1317 in the Islamic (Hijrī) calendar. According to this system, the letter *yā'* = 10; *shīn* = 1000; *rā'* = 200; *qāf* = 100; and *wāw* = 6 (the additional *wāw* is a poetic convention of expressing the final metrical accent as long). The text also has an added *alif* (= 1), which might be a typographical mistake. These numbers add up to 1316, or 1317 with the *alif.*\n\n[^26]: The author follows the composition year with the day and month: the 9th of *Muḥarram* (the first month of the Islamic calendar). Thus, the composition date is 9 *Muḥarram* 1316 or 1317, which corresponds to May 30, 1898 or May 20, 1899.\n"},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/e7fb56da-f95c-4e33-9c10-1326ba041f0b/canvas/7"},{"id":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/e7fb56da-f95c-4e33-9c10-1326ba041f0b/canvas/7/annotations/transcription","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"ar","format":"text/markdown","value":"- ﻓﯿﻨﻈﺮ ﷲ إﻟﻰ أﺣﻮاﻟﻜﻢ      \n\n  - أﺗﺼﺒﺮوا أو ﺗﺠز عوا ﻣﻦ ذﻟﻜﻢ \n\n- ﯾﺎ رب ﺛﺒﺘﻨﺎ ﻋﻠﻰ اﻹﺳﻼم    \n\n  - ﻓﻲ ﻛﻞ ﻓﺘﻨﺔ أو اﻵﻻم  \n\n- ﺗﻤﺖ ﻗﺼﯿﺪﺗﻲ ﺑﺤﻤﺪ ﷲ    \n\n  - أزﻛﻰ اﻟﺼﻼة ﻻﺑﻦ ﻋﺒﺪ ﷲ  \n\n- وآله واﻟﺼﺤﺐ واﻷزواج   \n\n  - ﻣﺎ ﺻﺮف اﻟﺪھﺮ ﺑﺄھﻞ اﻟﺘﺎج  \n\n- أﺑﯿﺎﺗﮭﺎ ﻓﺰ وﻋﺎم ﯾﺸﺮﻗﻮا \n\n  - ﺷﮭﺮ ﻣﺤﺮم ﻟﺘﺴﻊ ﺣﻘﻘﻮا  \n\n- ﺳﻤﯿﺘﮭﺎ ﻣﺸﺮع ﻣﺎء اﻟﺨﺒﺮ    \n\n  - ﻟﻮارد أوردھﺎ ﺑﺎﻟﻨﻈﺮ "},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/e7fb56da-f95c-4e33-9c10-1326ba041f0b/canvas/7"}]}]}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/api/facet/date/1899.json?sort=random","https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/api/facet/subject/tarykh-ghana.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Entrance to the Water Gorge of History, by One Who Comes to It with Insight (Colonial Poem 1) (Al-Ḥajj ʿUmar of Kete-Krachi, d. 1934) - Maktaba","description":"The first of three “colonial poems” written over the span of a decade by an influential scholar of the Volta region (Ghana), describing the colonial conquest of West Africa by various European powers.
