Exalted is the Lord, the Mighty and the Glorious. \n\n- Upon the best of all creatures on earth and high,\n\n  - God's blessings be and His peace forever more. \n\n- All the family and all the companions too, \n\n  - By all their grace we ask our Lord for good ending. \n\n- By many ages compute our verses[^67]\n\n  - That is our symbol; and we end our work.\n\n- But regarding the symbol of its *Hijra*[^68] *j.h.y.r.*\n\n  - *Sh.q*[^69] is its symbol till the very year.\n\n[^45]: All three names refer to *sūras* or chapters of the Qurʾan: Ṭāsīn begins the twenty-seventh chapter, Yāsin begins the thirty-sixth chapter, and seven chapters begin with Ḥāmīm, chapters forty to forty-six.\n\n[^46]: *Sūra Ankabūt*, the Spider, is the twenty-ninth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^47]: This is the opening chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^48]: This is the second and longest chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^49]: The twelfth chapter of the Qurʾan is named after the Prophet Yusuf or Joseph.\n\n[^50]: The sixteenth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^51]: The seventeenth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^52]: This refers to the eighteenth chapter of the Qurʾan, called *Ahl al-Kahf* or the \"People of the Cave,\" referring to people who were believed to have taken refuge in a cave to protect their faith and God made them sleep for more than three hundred years before they were discovered by a subsequent generation.\n\n[^53]: The twenty-first chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^54]: The twenty-fourth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^55]: The twenty-second chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^56]: Four months in the Islamic calendar are believed to be holy months: *Dhū al-Qaʿda*, *Dhū al-Ḥijja*, *al-Muḥarram* and *Rajab*.\n\n[^57]: The thirty-seventh chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^58]: Possibly a reference to the thirty-eighth chapter, *Sūra Ṣād*, in which the story of Dawud or David is recounted\n\n[^59]: The thirty-ninth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^60]: The forty-ninth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^61]: The fifty-ninth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^62]: These two refer, respectively, to the Pentateuch (Hebrew Torah) and the New Testament.\n\n[^63]: The Psalms of David.\n\n[^64]: The twenty-fourth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^65]: *Sūra al-Qalam* is the sixty-eighth chapter of the Qurʾan.\n\n[^66]: Referring to Prophet Muḥammad's close relatives.\n\n[^67]: Here the author employs an alphanumeric system commonly used by Muslim scholars, whereby specific numerical values are assigned to each of the 28 Arabic letters. He begins the verse with the word \"*duhūr*,\" meaning \"age,\" or \"epoch.\" The numerical values assigned to the letters of this word (*dāl* = 4; *hāʾ*= 5; *wāw* = 6; and *rāʾ*= 200) add up to 215, the number of verses in the poem.\n\n[^68]: Referring to the Islamic calendar dated from the year the Prophet Muḥammad migrated from Mecca to Medina.\n\n[^69]: Applying the same alphanumeric system described in a previous footnote, the author reveals the date of the poem's composition: *jīm* = 3; *hā* = 5; *yāʾ* = 10; *rāʾ* = 200; *shin* = 1000; *qāf* = 100. This equals 1318 in the Islamic calendar, or approximately 1901."},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/92de7073-c575-4b8d-b27d-54153524d127/canvas/17"},{"id":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/92de7073-c575-4b8d-b27d-54153524d127/canvas/17/annotations/transcription","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"ar","format":"text/markdown","value":"- وﺟﺎه ﺣﺮوف ﻛﺘﺐ ﷲ طﺮا \n  - وطﺎﺳﯿﻦ وﯾﺎﺳﯿﻦ وﺣﺎم\n\n- وﺳﻮرة ﻋﻨﻜﺒﻮت وﻋﺎدﯾﺎت \n  - وﻓﺎﺗﺤﺔ وﺟﺎه أﻟﻒ وﻻم\n\n- وﺳﻮرة ﯾﻮﺳﻒ واﻟﺮﻋﺪ ﻧﺤﻞ \n  - وإﺳﺮاء ﺗﻠﻲ ذﻛﺮ اﻟﻨِّﯿَﺎم وﺣﺞ \n\n- وﺳﻮرة اﻷﻧﺒﯿﺎء وﻧﻮر أﯾﻀًﺎ \n  - اﻟﺒﯿﺖ واﻟﺸﮭﺮ اﻟﺤﺮام\n\n- وﺻﺎﻓﺎت وداود وزﻣﺮ \n  - ﻛﺬا اﻟﺤﺠﺮات واﻟﺤﺸﺮ اﻻ ﺳﺎم\n\n- وﺗﻮرآة وإﻧﺠﯿﻞ ﺗﻠﯿﮭﺎ\n  - زَﺑُﻮرُ ﺛﻢ ﺑﺎﻟﻨﻮن و اﻻﻗﻼم\n\n- وﺟﺎه ﺻﺤﺎﺑﺔ واﻵل ﺟﻤﻌًﺎ\n  - ﺗﻌﺎﻟﻰ ذو اﻟﺠﻼل واﻹﻛﺮام\n\n- ﻋﻠﻰ ﺧﯿﺮاﻷﻧﺎم ﺳﻤًﺎ وأرﺿًﺎ\n  - ﺻﻼة واﻟﺴﻼم ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﺪوام\n\n- وﺟﻤﻊ اﻵل واﻷﺻﺤﺎب طﺮا \n  - وﻧﺴﺄل رﺑﻨﺎ ﺣﺴﻦ اﻟﺨﺘﺎم\n\n- دھﻮرًا ﻋﺪ أﺑﯿﺎت اﻟﻜﺘﺎب\n  - رﻣﺰﻧﺎ ھﺎ وﺗﻤﺖ ﺑﺎﻟﺘﻤﺎم\n\n- وأﻣﺎ رﻣﺰ ھﺠﺮﺗﮭﺎ ﺟﮭﯿﺮٌ\n  - ﺷ ﱞﻖ رَﻣّﺰته ﺣﺘﻰ ﻟﻌﺎم"},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/92de7073-c575-4b8d-b27d-54153524d127/canvas/17"}]}]}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/api/facet/date/1899-to-1900.json?sort=random","https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/api/facet/subject/tarykh-ghana.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"And Now, Our Purpose is to String Pearls, for Notifying and Warning Nobility (Colonial Poem 2) (Al-Ḥajj ʿUmar of Kete-Krachi, d. 1934) - Maktaba","description":"The second of three “colonial poems” written over the span of a decade by an influential scholar of the Volta region (Ghana), describing the colonial conquest of West Africa by European powers.
