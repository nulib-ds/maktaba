of the Christians (Colonial Poem 3) (Al-Ḥajj ʿUmar of Kete-Krachi, d. 1934) - Maktaba","description":"The third of three “colonial poems” written over the span of a decade by an influential scholar of the Volta region (Ghana), describing the colonial conquest of West Africa by European powers. Unlike the first two, which are in Arabic, this poem is in Hausa ʿajamī. Composed in 1907, after conquest had largely ceased and colonial rule was being consolidated, it offers commentary on the changes associated with European rule.
