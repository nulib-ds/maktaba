Henceforth quoted as *Ziyāda*.\n\n[^5]: The phrase starting with \"the one who...\" is the end of the *ṣalāt al-fātiḥ*, the most famous prayer formula of the Tijāniyya.

Rather, rejoice in the good news of Paradise, which you have been promised. We are your supporters in this worldly life and in the Hereafter.

The one whose truthfulness has reached this level attains the supreme form of truthfulness.\n\n**[II.2. Sincerity]**\n\nThe second (abode of faith) is sincerity (*ikhlāṣ*).

Wherever you find in the self (any trace of) hypocrisy, desire for reputation, or conceit, you have not become sincere. This is the sincerity of the common people.\n\nFor the elite, sincerity is not to act for the sake of a reward, nor out of fear of punishment, nor for arriving at a spiritual station. Rather, you act out of servitude (*ʿubūdiyya*) and longing. Servitude means that you act for no reason other than that God is a deity deserving of worship, and that you are a servant to whom nothing is befitting apart from service (*khidma*). So, you act for him and do not see yourself as deserving anything from Him, while witnessing His favor. Witnessing His favor is to see that your (good) deeds are from God to you. God has created (them) and attributed (them) to you as an act of grace for you.\n\nThe sincerity of the elite of the elite is to exclude anything other (than God) from the intercourse with God. This also pertains to your own self, so that you see that deeds are from God, to God, and by God, while you have no entry in them and no exit from them. The Most High said: \"Verily, God loves the sincere.\"[^24]\n\n**[II.3. Serenity]**\n\nThe third (abode of faith) is serenity (*ṭuʾmanīna*).

The one who has reached this station may utter words that will make someone who does not have the full capacity of differentiation (between spiritual states) believe that he has spiritually arrived, whereas he has not. But he discerns the Reality from behind a fine veil, and he takes knowledge (*ʿulūm*) through understanding and tasting, not through witnessing (*mushāhada*). This is the contemplation of the elite before witnessing.\n\nThe contemplation after witnessing is the contemplation of the elite of the elite. This type of contemplation is the most precious station of the stations of the spiritually accomplished ones,[^28] and it is the result of cognizance (*maʿrifa*).\n\n\n[^25]: This is the beginning of a widely used prayer formula, known as *al-Muʿawwaliyya*.
