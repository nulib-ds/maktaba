May God pour out His prayer and salvation on our master, Muḥammad, on his family and on his companions.\n\n- O you who question me about the status of the *siwāk*[^1]\n  - and what *fiqh*[^2] has decided on this subject!\n\n- I answer: May God guide you towards the straight path, O you who ask the best of questions!\n  - The question you asked is among the essential points of Religion.\n\n- Here is a peremptory response. If you retain it,\n  - you will be, O young man!, sage and insightful.\n\n- On the subject \\[of *siwāk*\\] there are several *ḥadīths*[^3] of Aḥmad,\n  - transmitted in a sure manner, by men of confidence according to other men of confidence.\n\n- The Messenger of God had established his *siwāk* as a precept,\n  - and it became, for us, a rule of conduct through effort.\n\n- Still, it is necessary, from time to time, to stress this point.\n  - Thus, I will let you know all its merits, one by one.\n\n- Whether during ablutions, prayer, prostration, recitation \\[of the Qurʾan\\],\n  - or when the teeth turn yellow, quickly use the *siwāk*.\n\n- Just as when you are alone, before sleeping, after waking up,\n  - during a long silence or if you have bad breath.\n\n- After having eaten or if you enter a home,\n  - use the *siwāk*, you will thus respect the Tradition \\[of the Prophet\\].\n\n- Privilege prayer after having used the *siwāk*,\n  - as it is mentioned in the *ḥadīth* of the Chosen one, the Virtuous.\n\n- The use of the *siwāk* is disapproved only for he who fasts,\n  - and that only until the afternoon, according to certain *imāms*.[^4]\n\n- Do not forget to pronounce \"*bismillāh*\"[^5] when you begin to use the *siwāk*.\n  - The rest is done without invocation.\n\n- It is recommended to use the *siwāk* across the width of the tongue,\n  - \\[and\\] its length, as stipulated in various texts and commentaries.\n\n- Any soft *siwāk* stick, even of poor quality,\n  - can be used, without a doubt.\n\n- However, it is preferable to use arak wood[^6] because\n  - this was the *siwāk* used by the Messenger of God, the guide of all creatures.\n\n- You cannot use a finger in place of the *siwāk*\n  - when you have one with you. Such is the order of the community.\n\n- The length of your *siwāk* should be the equivalent of one *shibr.*[^7] Do not take it any longer,\n  - for any part which exceeds \\[the *shibr*\\], Satan occupies it.\n\n- Grasp your *siwāk* with your right hand, putting\n  - your fingers on top of it, according to the Tradition \\[of the Prophet\\],\n\n\n[^1]: The *siwāk* is a twig used to clean teeth, typically taken from the *Salvadora persica* tree, which has antibacterial properties. These natural toothbrushes have been used throughout the Arabo-Muslim world since antiquity.\n\n[^2]: Although often translated as \"Islamic jurisprudence,\" *fiqh* originally meant \"understanding, knowledge, intelligence.\"\n\n[^3]: *Ḥadīth*: An action or saying of the Prophet Muḥammad, constituting a source of Islamic law. \"Aḥmad\" is an alternative name for the Prophet Muḥammad.\n\n[^4]: *Imām*: an Islamic leadership position, often the prayer leader in a mosque.\n\n[^5]: *Bismillāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm*: In the name of God, the Most Righteous, the Most Merciful. One of the most important phrases for Muslims, who speak it when initiating many activities and during daily prayer.\n\n[^6]: *Salvadora persica*, known as the arak tree, is a small evergreen found in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.\n\n[^7]: *Shibr*: the span of a hand, between the thumb and little finger.\n"},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/f0779514-e7c3-41b9-89d0-38ceea3f0e8a/canvas/0"},{"id":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/f0779514-e7c3-41b9-89d0-38ceea3f0e8a/canvas/0/annotations/transcription","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"ar","format":"text/markdown","value":"بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم صلى الله على سيدنا محمد وآله وصحبه وسلم تسليما  \n\n- أيا سائلاً لي عن سِوَاكٍ وحُكْمِهِ  \n  -

It refers to the *Ranunculus asiaticus* (Persian buttercup)--a poisonous plant known to repel the insects that can gnaw at manuscript paper and bindings. Writing \"*kaykataj*\" on the manuscript was believed to have a repellent effect. There are several variations of this word. *Kaykataj* is used in the western Africa region, while in other parts of the Islamic world, it is \"*kabīkaj*,\" \"*kaykaj*,\" or \"*kabkaj*.\" See Dorrit Van Dalen, \"Damage and Protection,\" Lesson 7, Mouse&Manuscript (Leiden University), accessed October 17, 2024, [https://mouse.digitalscholarship.nl/lessons/damage-and-protection](https://mouse.digitalscholarship.nl/lessons/damage-and-protection); and \"Kabīkaj,\" in Adam Gacek, *Arabic Manuscripts: A Vademecum for Readers* (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 137-38."},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/f0779514-e7c3-41b9-89d0-38ceea3f0e8a/canvas/1"},{"id":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/f0779514-e7c3-41b9-89d0-38ceea3f0e8a/canvas/1/annotations/transcription","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"ar","format":"text/markdown","value":"- سوى خِنصرٍ يا صاحي فاجْعله تحتهُ\n  - وإبليسُ باليسرى يَسُوكُ وجُنْدُه \n- ولا تأخذِ المسواكَ ضَمًّا بقَبْضَةٍ \n  - لإِيراثِهِ البَاسُورَ  جَالبَ صُفْرَةِ\n- إذا اسْتَكْتَ فاجْعلْ جانبَ السِّنِّ أيْمَنًا \n  - ولا تحملِ المسواكَ إلا بِنِيَّةِ\n- وإياك أن تستاك في غائطٍ\n  - وبولٍ ومستلقٍ  على ظهرِ فَقْرةِ\n- ومنها رضا الرحمن معْ حُبِّ ملاك\n  - ومَسْخَطِ شيطانٍ وإطفاء مِرّةِ\n- ويجلو عيونا ثم يقطع بلْغما \n  - ويعطي لضُعْف السِّنِّ غايةَ قوةِ\n- وبلعُك ريقًا أولًا من تَسوُّكٍ \n  - أمانُ جذام بل شفا كلِّ عِلَّةِ\n- ومن بعده لا تبلع الريق يا فتى \n  - مخافة وسْواسٍ مشوّشِ فكرةِ\n- ومن طرفيه لا تكن قطُّ عاصِلاً\n  - وإن كنت ذا عقل قبلت وصيتي\n- إذا استاك إنسانٌ وأهمل غُسْله \n  - فيلعقه  الشيطان مطرودُ لَعنةِ\n- ويكره للمستاك مصُّ سواكه \n  - ففي مصّه للعيْن أقوى مضرّةِ\n- ومن عادة الأبرار دفنُ بُصاقهم \n  - بِتُرْبٍ إذا استاكوا وهمْ أهلُ مكةِ\n- وعوِّدْ بمسواكٍ صبيّك يا أخي \n  - ليعتاد بالخير في حال نشأةِ\n- وتمت بتوفيق الإله قصيدتي \n  - وما في سواكٍ من كلامٍ وحكمةِ\n- ولكنني نظمي ختمت مصليا \n  - وما في سواكٍ من كلامٍ وحكمةِ\n- ولكنني نظمي ختمت مصليا\n  - على خير خلق الله شافعُ أمةِ\n- محمدٍ المختارِ من نسلِ هاشم \n  - وآلٍ وصحبٍ ثم زوجٍ وعِترةِ\n\n الحمد لله رب العالمين. الصلاة والسلام على من وجبت له الشفاعة.\n كيكتج\n"},"target":"https://iiif-maktaba.dc.library.northwestern.edu/f0779514-e7c3-41b9-89d0-38ceea3f0e8a/canvas/1"}]}]}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/api/facet/date/undefined.json?sort=random","https://nulib-ds.github.io/maktaba/api/facet/subject/fqh-abadat.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Poem on the Use of the Siwāk (tooth stick) (Anonymous, c. 19th century) - Maktaba","description":"A poem providing instruction in the proper use of the siwāk--a teeth cleaning stick widely used throughout the Muslim world.
