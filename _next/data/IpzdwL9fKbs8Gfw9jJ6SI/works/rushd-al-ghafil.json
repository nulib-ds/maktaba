*Guide for the Heedless* *(Rushd al-ghāfil)* by ʿAbd Allāh ibn\nal-Ḥājj Ibrāhīm al-ʿAlawī**\n\n*Translated by Ariela Marcus-Sells*\n\nIn the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. May the\nprayers of God Most High be upon his noble prophet and his family, peace\nbe upon them.\n\nThis text is *The Guide for the Heedless* by the learned Imam Sīdī ʿAbd\nAllāh ibn al-Ḥājj Ibrāhīm\n\n- All praise belongs to God, who led us\n\n  - to the truth and away from falsehood, and denied us\n\n- What the best of the honored ones forbade us\n\n  - may our Lord bring him peace and pray upon him.\n\n- \\[Falsehood\\] incurs disapproval and prohibition,[^1]\n\n  - within it all the sciences of evil are discerned.\n\n- It includes conferring on someone a benefit or an affliction,\n\n  - which, according to law, is not deserved,\n\n- Or peering into the realm of the unseen \n\n  - or deploying a name for a worldly decree.\n\n- To masters of the sciences of evil, bring the good news -\n\n  - of their humiliating poverty and grim fate.[^2]\n\n- *Hīmiyyā, sīmiyyā,* and *ruqiyyas* known\n\n  - to harm are considered sorcery -\n\n- Celestial is the first, and the second is,\n\n  - like oil and ointment, of the earth -\n\n- As are some properties of realities when\n\n  - their power over souls (*nufūs*) is proven,\n\n- Like the pollen of a date palm, the hairs stuck in a comb,[^3]\n\n  - and a dog's biting of seven stones,\n\n- And engraving names with a link, so they claim,\n\n  - to a planet or a celestial sphere, \"a talisman\" let's say,\n\n- On any substance with a soul (*nafs*) that is suitable.\n\n  - And in the adjurations a defect is found\n\n- From ignorance of the divine names by which\n\n  - the adjured angels are bound.\n\n- For the *jinn* and the planets there are \"evocations,\" let's say,\n\n  - with perfumes and clothes specific to each,\n\n- Most of it is apostasy - no success can one reap\n\n  - When to evil he inclines.\n\n- It includes sand writing, forms, and birth-charts,\n\n  - along with omens and the casting of lots\n\n- If used for acquisition, even when found in a book.\n\n  - Scalpomancy is, by some, included in its number,\n\n- And it also includes music and thunder.\n\n  - Scrying and fortune-telling are of no use -\n\n- Those are reports about the past and\n\n  - events to come. So beware and leave them alone!\n\n- By tradition, it is classified as apostasy,\n\n  - whether by speech, by creed, or by deed.\n\n**End of first page of manuscript text.**\n\n- And permitted things, like a comb, might be mixed\n\n  - with things forbidden, like illicit sex.\n\n- Sorcery produces hate and likewise love it can instill.\n\n  - It forces changes to a body and it can kill,\n\n- And compel stupidity, and turn a person\n\n  - into something else, like a horse or a donkey.\n\n- Along a slender thread \\[the sorcerer\\] can flow.\n\n  - He flies and shrinks until through a peephole he can go.\n\n- A *sughniyyā* sucks the blood out of the heart, \n\n  - just as an imposter draws it out by an attractive art.\n\n- As in India, it can occur naturally,\n\n  - but most achieve it painstakingly.\n\n- Separating someone from their possessions can be commissioned,\n\n  - among both the Jews and others it has been witnessed.\n\n- But sorcery is blocked from accomplishing certain things,\n\n  - like killing, or sprouting crops, instantly, or splitting the seas -\n\n- Or - those who have \\[true\\] knowledge say - learning about the unseen,\ncuring the blind,\n\n  - speaking foreign tongues, or bringing the dead to life.\n\n- The science of treasure and the science of alchemy\n\n  - they have warned you about and afraid of God you should be.\n\n- Counted among it are the raptures of singing,\n\n  - intoned by a singer, his raising voice lifting.[^4]\n\n- In this the listener and the singer are the same,\n\n  - those hidden and apparent agree in what they say\n\n- About the permitted, the prohibited, and the conditional, which depends,\n\n  - on whether or not \\[the singing\\] is combined with an instrument.\n   \n- If so, then it is forbidden, everyone agrees -\n\n  - unlike those instances that are permitted, like longing\n\n- For God, or for joyous occasions such as banquets, holidays, and acts of\ncelebration \n\n  - of the day of someone's return or \\[the Qur'an's\\] memorization,\n\n- Or for weddings, or to encourage the birth, or celebrate the arrival, of\na child,\n\n  - or listening to the songs of the camel-driver, or to quote a poem\n\n- That is not connected to anything that has to do\n\n  - with descriptions of wine, or slander, or satire,\n\n- Or without an instrument, in the style of the singing of the Arabs who,\n\n  - gave it the name \"al-Naṣb\" -\n\n- \\[For these\\], no difference in legal judgement will you find\n\n  - for versified Arabic or songs that are linguistically unrefined.\n\n- Even now, people gather for *dhikr*\n\n  - and to recite the Qur'an across the lands.[^5]\n\n- His sound text refutes the one who disapproved,\n\n  - ignorance of what became apparent is his excuse.\n\n- One should hold to it fast,\n\n  - That perception might the Most Beautiful grasp.\n\n- But authorization to do it out loud will be based\n\n  - on the lack of something prohibited, like conceit, taking place.\n\n- In this, it is like waking someone or mingling socially,\n\n  - as the alert ones related along with similar things.\n\n- Indeed, \\[*dhikr*\\] awakens the hearts of the heedless\n\n  - and increases the ignorant in labor and learning.\n\n- So hold it close, morning and evening,\n\n  - with the masters of exemplary guidance.\n\n- And one might lighten the load of the one who recites,\n\n  - for some consider that to be right.\n\n- But \\[*dhikr*\\] does have a condition - it must be free of what is\nprohibited\n\n  - and things whose rejection has been decreed.\n\n- And women are prohibited from attending,\n\n  - or at least should not be perceived,\n\n- Whether physically or orally. So recite to the people\n\n  - \\[these\\] three verses by Abū ʿAbbās[^6]:\n\n- \"During \\[*dhikr*\\], it is not the way of men to dance\n\n  - without feeling the state's oncoming rush.\n\n- And whoever is strong enough to hold still\n\n  - will be spared from suspicious thoughts.\n\n- There it has not been permitted to smile,\n\n  - to joke, or \\[even\\] to talk\"\n\n- Or to peer about or at a participant stare.\n\n  - One should not hear a sound,\n\n- Or hem and haw, or move around,\n\n  - If restraint is possible for you.\n\n- In city mosques, where one fears the disturbance,\n\n  - Restraining from \\[*dhikr*\\] is among the acts of the virtuous,\n\n- As is the bowing of heads, and it\n\n  - can be done standing, without restriction.\n\n- Among them is purification and freshening the room it is in,\n\n  - as well as one's clothes, for the sake of believing *jinn*.\n\n- When gathering for *dhikr* or for learning, it is the proper etiquette\n\n  - to form a circle out of those who sit.\n\n- On meeting outside the proper time we can agree,\n\n  - if the appointed hour passed by unintentionally.\n\n- *The Guide for the Heedless* has been completed,\n\n  - A piece of advice from me to all the heedless\n\n- All praise belongs to God for finishing it\n\n  - and its commentary, to the conclusion from the first hemistich.\n\n- Then may the prayers and peace of God\n\n  - Be upon the one who guided all mankind\n\n- And his family, his companions -- the best community,\n\n  - The well-spring of knowledge and the mine of nobility.\n\n[^1]: Prohibition (*manʿ*) and disapproval (*kurḥ*) are technical legal\n    terms. Prohibited acts are forbidden, while acts that merit\n    disapproval are discouraged.\n\n[^2]: This line is located in a different place in the Boutilimit\n    manuscript but is found at this location in all four copies of the\n    commentary that I consulted. For one example, see ʿAbd Allāh ibn\n    Ibrāhīm al-ʿAlawī, \"Sharḥ rushd al-rhāfil,\" BnF MS Arabe 5599\n    (Paris), fo. 44b.\n\n[^3]: The pollen of the date-palm tree and the \"comb with the hairs\n    stuck to it\" are both referenced in a hadith that relates how the\n    prophet was ensorcelled by a man named Labīd ibn al-Aʿṣam. See\n    al-Bukhārī, *Ṣaḥīḥ*, *k. al-ṭibb*, 47.\n\n[^4]: This line is missing from the Boutilimit manuscript but is present\n    in all copies of the commentaries. See ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ibrāhīm\n    al-ʿAlawī, \"Sharḥ rushd al-rhāfil,\" BnF MS Arabe 5599 (Paris), fo.\n    50a.\n\n[^5]: In the Boutilimit manuscript, this line is followed by another\n    that seems to have been erroneously copied from the commentary. See\n    ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ibrāhīm al-ʿAlawī, \"Sharḥ rushd al-rhāfil,\" BnF MS\n    Arabe 5599 (Paris), fo. 51b.\n\n[^6]: In his commentary, Sīdī ʿAbd Allah refers to him as Ibn Zakrī,\n    which would make him Abū ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Maghrāwī\n    al-Tilimsānī (d. 900/1494). This Ibn Zakrī was a judge and a scholar\n    of Islamic law, theology, and the Arabic language in Tlemcen. He was\n    also the teacher of some celebrated Sufis, including Aḥmad Zarrūq\n    (d. 899/1493).
